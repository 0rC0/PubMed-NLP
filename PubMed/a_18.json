However, research on the prevention of atherosclerosis through consuming individual whole berries, specifically direct evidence, remains scarce. Therefore, further elucidating the role that berries play in the prevention of atherosclerosis is warranted. In this perspective, blueberries were selected to articulate research strategies for studying atheroprotective effects of berries. Studies from human subjects and various animal models are summarized. The mechanisms by which blueberries may act, through reducing oxidative stress, decreasing inflammation, improving endothelial dysfunction, regulating cholesterol accumulation and trafficking, along with potentially influencing gut microbiota, are also discussed. Blueberries contain high levels of polyphenolic compounds, which were widely indicated as major bioactive compounds. Nonetheless, the metabolites/catabolites after blueberry consumption, such as simple phenolic acids, rather than original compounds in berries, may be the actual in vivo bioactive compounds. Future research should focus on obtaining more direct evidence, preferably in humans, understanding of the mechanisms of action at the molecular level, and identifying bioactive compounds as well as which compounds act synergistically to convey health benefits.

In the present study, three species of Hyalomma ticks, Hyalomma aegyptium, H. marginatum and H. excavatum, were examined for the presence of zoonotic bacteria, both male and female ticks alike. Examination of microbial diversity with tag-encoded pyrosequencing indicates that H. marginatum and H. excavatum were more diversity rich than H. aegyptium.

As an extension of NMF, Symmetric NMF (SNMF) inherits the advantages of NMF. Unlike NMF, however, SNMF takes a nonnegative similarity matrix as an input, and two lower rank nonnegative matrices (H, H<sup>T</sup>) are computed as an output to approximate the original similarity matrix. Laplacian regularization has improved the clustering performance of NMF and SNMF. However, Laplacian regularization (LR), as a classic manifold regularization method, suffers some problems because of its weak extrapolating ability. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of SNMF, called Hessian regularization based symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (HSNMF), for this purpose. In contrast to Laplacian regularization, Hessian regularization fits the data perfectly and extrapolates nicely to unseen data. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets including text data, gene expression data and HMP (Human Microbiome Project) data.

The composition of the microbiota largely determines the levels of tryptophan in the systemic circulation and hence, indirectly, the levels of serotonin in the brain. Some microbiota synthesize neurotransmitters directly, e.g., gamma-amino butyric acid, while modulating the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). The composition of the microbiota determines the levels and nature of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) which in turn has profound effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptors, thereby influencing epithelial barrier integrity and the presence of an inflammatory or tolerogenic environment in the intestine and beyond. The composition of the microbiota also determines the levels and ratios of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate and propionate. Butyrate is a key energy source for colonocytes. Dysbiosis leading to reduced levels of SCFAs, notably butyrate, therefore may have adverse effects on epithelial barrier integrity, energy homeostasis, and the T helper 17/regulatory/T cell balance.

Analysis of the consequences of this diversity has been complicated by the exquisite sensitivity these bacteria have evolved to environmental inputs, inducing rapid and substantial fluctuations in behaviors, and often only within subpopulations of the organisms. Thus, the conditions under which the oral microbiota is studied can produce widely different results within and between species. Fortunately, continually diminishing costs and ongoing refinements in sequencing and metabolomics are making it practical to study the oral microbiome at a level that will create a sufficiently robust understanding of the functions of individual organisms and reveal the complex interrelationships of these microbes (\"the known unknowns\") in a way that researchers will be able to engage in the rational design of reliable and economical risk assessments and preventive therapies.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Advances in dental research"}, {"PMID": 28914591, "Abstract": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

Mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in CAC was significantly different from the ones in SC or in HS, while the fungal showed no differences. Comparison between mucosa-associated microbiota on the tumor site or in normal mucosa near the tumor showed very similar patterns. The global mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in cancer patients was characterized by a restriction in biodiversity but no change for the fungal community. Compared to SC, CAC was characterized by an increase of Enterobacteriacae family and Sphingomonas genus and a decrease of Fusobacterium and Ruminococcus genus.

The aim of this nutritional intervention is to prevent or correct signs, symptoms and complications of renal insufficiency, delaying the start of dialysis and preserving nutritional status. This paper focuses on three additional aspects of renal diets that can play an important role in the management of CKD patients: the vitamin K1 and fiber content, and the alkalizing potential. We examined the energy and nutrients composition of four types of renal diets according to their protein content: normal diet (ND, 0.8 g protein/kg body weight (bw)), low protein diet (LPD, 0.6 g protein/kg bw), vegan diet (VD, 0.7 g protein/kg bw), very low protein diet (VLPD, 0.3 g protein/kg bw). Fiber content is much higher in the VD and in the VLPD than in the ND or LPD. Vitamin K1 content seems to follow the same trend, but vitamin K2 content, which could not be investigated, might have a different pattern. The net endogenous acid production (NEAP) value decreases from the ND and LPD to the vegetarian diets, namely VD and VLPD; the same finding occurred for the potential renal acid load (PRAL). In conclusion, renal diets may provide additional benefits, and this is the case of vegetarian diets. Namely, VD and VLPD also provide high amounts of fibers and Vitamin K1, with a very low acid load. These features may have favorable effects on Vitamin K1 status, intestinal microbiota and acid-base balance.

Plasma IS and PCS, fecal indole (the precursor of IS), p-cresol (the precursor of PCS) and 19 kinds of amino acids were analyzed by LC-MS. During CKD progression, 5/6 Nx rats showed increased plasma IS, PCS concentration and increased fecal indole, p-cresol concentration. 5/6 Nx rats also showed disordered gut amino acids metabolism profile which became more significant along with the progession of CKD. The abundance of some specific gut bacteria also changed significantly in 5/6 Nx rats.

Clostridium family XI increased 3.50-25.34% in the presence of tetracycline at 40 days for individual C. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) confirmed the pyrosequencing findings of inter-individual variability of the ratio of phylotypes and the effect of tetracycline. Among the 23 tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) screened, four tet genes (tetO, Q, W, and X) were major TRGs in control and tetracycline-dosed fecal samples. A variable to slight increase of copy number of TRGs appeared to be related to tetracycline treatment, interindividual variability and duration of exposure. Despite, the inherent variability of the intestinal microbiota observed among or within individuals, this pilot study contributes to the knowledge base of the impact of low residue concentrations of tetracycline on the human intestinal microbiome on the potential for antimicrobial resistance.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Anaerobe"}, {"PMID": 29987933, "Abstract": "Consumption of pectin contributes to changes in the gut microbiota and the metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

The sulfation patterns of these glycosaminoglycans are highly variable, which presents a significant enzymatic challenge to the polysaccharide lyases and sulfatases that mediate degradation. It is possible that the bacterium recruits lyases with highly plastic specificities and expresses a repertoire of enzymes that target substructures of the glycosaminoglycans with variable sulfation or that the glycans are desulfated before cleavage by the lyases. To distinguish between these mechanisms, the components of the <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> Hep/HS degrading apparatus were analyzed. The data showed that the bacterium expressed a single-surface endo-acting lyase that cleaved HS, reflecting its higher molecular weight compared with Hep. Both Hep and HS oligosaccharides imported into the periplasm were degraded by a repertoire of lyases, with each enzyme displaying specificity for substructures within these glycosaminoglycans that display a different degree of sulfation. Furthermore, the crystal structures of a key surface glycan binding protein, which is able to bind both Hep and HS, and periplasmic sulfatases reveal the major specificity determinants for these proteins.

Early investigations of the oral microbiota relied on culture-based methods to determine the major bacteria in health and disease. Microbial monitoring using gene probes facilitated study of larger populations. DNA probe methods confirmed and expanded the importance of transmission of bacteria from mother to infant and association of preselected species, including mutans streptococci and lactobacilli with caries in larger populations. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) probes confirmed the wide diversity of species in oral and caries microbiomes.

To investigate the functional significance of the delineated subspecies, we identified genes that consistently distinguish them in a manner that is independent of reference genomes. We further associated these subspecies-specific genes with properties of the microbial community and the host. For example, two of the three <i>Eubacterium rectale</i> subspecies consistently harbor an accessory pro-inflammatory flagellum operon that is associated with lower gut community diversity, higher host BMI, and higher blood fasting insulin levels. Using an additional 676 human oral samples, we further demonstrate the existence of niche specialized subspecies in the different parts of the oral cavity. Taken together, we provide evidence for subspecies in the majority of abundant gut prokaryotes, leading to a better functional and ecological understanding of the human gut microbiome in conjunction with its host.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Molecular systems biology"}, {"PMID": 29317660, "Abstract": "The recently discovered histone post-translational modification crotonylation connects cellular metabolism to gene regulation. Its regulation and tissue-specific functions are poorly understood. We characterize histone crotonylation in intestinal epithelia and find that histone H3 crotonylation at lysine 18 is a surprisingly abundant modification in the small intestine crypt and colon, and is linked to gene regulation. We show that this modification is highly dynamic and regulated during the cell cycle. We identify class I histone deacetylases, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, as major executors of histone decrotonylation. We show that known HDAC inhibitors, including the gut microbiota-derived butyrate, affect histone decrotonylation. Consistent with this, we find that depletion of the gut microbiota leads to a global change in histone crotonylation in the colon.

A novel methodology was developed that enabled anoxic cell cultivation (17d maximum time tested) and cell passage. In the absence of oxygen, cell morphology is significantly altered. All cells tested exhibited morphologic changes, i.e., a combination of tethered (monolayer-like) and runagate (suspension-like) morphologies. Both morphologies replicated (Vero and HeLa cells tested) and could be passaged anaerobically. In the absence of exogenous oxygen, anoxic cells produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Anaerobic runagate HeLa and Vero cells increased ROS production from day 3 to day 10 by 2- and 3-fold, respectively. In contrast, anoxic tethered HeLa and Vero cells either showed no significant change in ROS production between days 3 and 10 or exhibited a 3-fold decrease in ROS, respectively. Detection of ROS was inversely related to detection of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF1) mRNA and HIF-1 protein expression which cycled over a 10-day period.

The main cause has been founded in alterations of the enteric flora and of the intestinal barrier probably due to portal hypertension, in addition to a reticulo-endothelial system dysfunction. Furthermore, those living with cirrhosis can report a high predisposition to sepsis and septic shock, due to the excessive response of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a complessive hemodynamic derangement. By the analysis in the experimental model of the cirrhotic rat, it was demonstrated that radio-labelled Escherichia coli given by the oral route resulted in the location of the bacteria in the gut, the ascitic fluid and mesenteric lymph nodes, a phenomenon known as bacterial translocation. Bacteria encountered with the highest frequency are those colonizing the intestinal tract, such as E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae, intracellular bacteria and parasites are reported with a lower frequency. Multi-drug resistant bacteria are cultured with the highest frequency in those with frequent hospitalisations and report both high septic shock and mortality rates. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the commonest infection in cirrhotic, estimated to occur in 10-30% of the cases with ascites. A practical approach may include administration of a protected penicillin, III generation cephalosporin or quinolones in uncomplicated cases. Instead, in complicated cases and in nosocomial SBP, administration of cephalosporin or quinolones can be burned by the high resistance rate and drugs active against ESBL-producing bacteria and multi-drug resistant Gram positive bacteria have to be considered as empiric therapy, until cultures are available.

The microbial signatures of periodontally healthy smokers, but not diabetics, were highly aligned with the disease-associated microbiomes of their respective cohorts.

They are also abundant in common foodstuffs and can be produced and degraded by the constitutive microbiota. The ability to use trace amines has arisen at least twice during evolution, with distinct receptor families present in invertebrates and vertebrates. The term \"trace amine\" was coined to reflect the low tissue levels in mammals; however, invertebrates have relatively high levels where they function like mammalian adrenergic systems, involved in \"fight-or-flight\" responses. Vertebrates express a family of receptors termed trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Humans possess six functional isoforms (TAAR1, TAAR2, TAAR5, TAAR6, TAAR8, and TAAR9), whereas some fish species express over 100. With the exception of TAAR1, TAARs are expressed in olfactory epithelium neurons, where they detect diverse ethological signals including predators, spoiled food, migratory cues, and pheromones. Outside the olfactory system, TAAR1 is the most thoroughly studied and has both central and peripheral roles. In the brain, TAAR1 acts as a rheostat of dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic neurotransmission and has been identified as a novel therapeutic target for schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. In the periphery, TAAR1 regulates nutrient-induced hormone secretion, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity.

It has been shown that certain genomes of infant gut commensals, in particular those of bifidobacterial species, are genetically adapted to utilize specific glycans of this human secretory fluid, thus representing a very intriguing example of host-microbe coevolution, where both partners are believed to benefit. In recent years, various metagenomic studies have tried to dissect the composition and functionality of the infant gut microbiome and to explore the distribution across the different ecological niches of the infant gut biogeography of the corresponding microbial consortia, including those corresponding to bacteria and viruses, in healthy and ill subjects. Such analyses have linked certain features of the microbiota/microbiome, such as reduced diversity or aberrant composition, to intestinal illnesses in infants or disease states that are manifested at later stages of life, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders.

Faecal samples were collected; lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were isolated on selective media and their immunomodulatory activity was tested in mouse dendritic cells (DCs). Pre-incubation with lactobacilli increased LPS-induced expression of the maturation markers CD80 and CD86, whereas pre-incubation with bifidobacteria decreased such expression.

After 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of treatment, bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from oral swabs sampled from the cheek pouches of the hamsters. The oral bacterial communities present in different hamster groups were characterized by sequencing the hypervariable regions V1-V2 and V4 of 16S rRNA using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Fifteen phyla, 27 classes, 59 orders, 123 families, and 250 genera were identified from 4,962,673 sequence reads from the cheek pouch samples. The bacterial diversity and taxonomic abundances for the different treatment groups were compared to the non-treated hamsters. Bacterial diversity was significantly decreased after 4 weeks of exposure to 2.5\u202fmg, and significantly increased by exposure to 250\u202fmg STP.

However, little is known about the metabolic activity of these cellular compartments, which is the basic function underlying all other additional tasks the cells perform. Here we perform intravital NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging in the small intestine of fluorescent reporter mice to monitor the NAD(P)H-dependent metabolism of epithelial and myeloid cells. The majority of myeloid cells which comprise the surveilling network in the lamina propria have a low metabolic activity and remain resting even upon stimulation. Only a few myeloid cells, typically localized at the tip of the villi, are metabolically active and are able to activate NADPH oxidases upon stimulation, leading to an oxidative burst. In contrast, the epithelial cells are metabolically highly active and, although not considered professional phagocytes, are also able to activate NADPH oxidases, leading to massive production of reactive oxygen species. Whereas the oxidative burst in myeloid cells is mainly catalyzed by the NOX2 isotype, in epithelial cells other isotypes of the NADPH oxidases family are involved, especially NOX4. They are constitutively expressed by the epithelial cells, but activated only on demand to ensure rapid defense against pathogens.

In this context, it is necessary to reassess the immunomodulatory properties of human defensins that are variably expressed by cerebral microglia, astrocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells and exhibit complex and often confounding roles in neuroinflammatory processes. Therefore, in this review we describe current contributions in this field and we propose novel hypotheses regarding the potential impact of defensin-related pathways on virus-driven autoimmune neurodegeneration. In this regard, we have previously proposed that abnormal expression of defensins by penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the pathophysiology of Helicobacter pylori-related brain neurodegenerative disorders through variable modulations of innate and adaptive immune responses. We hereby propose that impaired expression of defensins by structural components of the BBB may impede glymphatic circulation and disrupt receptor signalling in pericytes that is essential for microvascular stability, thereby retaining blood-derived toxins and bystander activated T-cells in the brain and further impairing BBB integrity and hampering viral clearance. Autoreactive T-cell infiltrates in neuronaxonal lesions characteristic of chronic central nervous system diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are directed against both, myelin and non-myelin, antigens the precise nature of which remains enigmatic. Inadequate expression of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a gene expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells, induces the recruitment of defensin-specific T-cells. These cells may access the brain, thereby causing a decrease in defensin expression and subsequent down-regulation of CD91/LRP1-mediated clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 that ultimately accumulates as protein deposits. It should be highlighted that \u03b2-amyloid brain deposits are a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. During human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, selective elicitation of the VH1-69 antibody subfamily directed against specific, viral glycoprotein epitopes, often correlates with a higher likelihood of developing autoimmune disorders. In addition, we propose that recently described defensin affinity towards the same epitopes may prevent proper viral fusion, but at the expense of augmenting autoimmune reactivity. Moreover, in the context of complex and largely unknown symbiotic relations between host microbiota and pathogenic viruses, we propose that co-stimulation of defensin expression may modulate adaptive immune responses thereby enhancing inflammatory cascades responsible for autoimmunity. Finally, we describe current evidence that supports the hypothesis of a possible involvement of defensins in HCV-related autoimmunity. Exploring further potential implications of human defensins in virus-related autoimmunity may lead to improved strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Medical hypotheses"}, {"PMID": 29278509, "Abstract": "Obesity is a major public health issue as it is causally associated with several chronic disorders, including type-2 diabetes, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. In the United States and other countries worldwide, the obesity epidemic has drastically impacted the status of health of millions as well as healthcare costs. Aside from poor diet, hygiene, and genetics, there are many other factors thought to play an important role in the emergence of obesity. Nowadays, accumulating evidence is elucidating the relation of dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria with obesity and metabolic disorders. Certain gut microbial strains have been shown to inhibit or attenuate immune responses related to chronic inflammation in experimental models, suggesting that specific species among gut microbiota may play either a protective or a pathogenic role in the progression of obesity. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can therefore represent a therapeutic approach for obesity treatment. FMT is a relatively straightforward therapy that manipulates the human gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota by transferring healthy donor microbiota into an existing but disturbed microbial ecosystem. However, the relevant scientific work is still in its early stages.

Herein, we have investigated the anti-obesity effects of two citrus peel extracts obtained via supercritical fluid extraction: PMF A, with a lower content of PMFs and HOPMFs, and PMF B, with a higher content of PMFs and HOPMFs. PMF A and PMF B were administered orally for 16 weeks to mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. The results showed that PMF B decreased the lipid content more statistically significantly (p < 0.05) than PMF A in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, reduced the adipocyte size, decreased the adipose tissue weight and alleviated the total body weight in the HFD mice. Both PMF A and PMF B reduced the adipocyte size in the perigonadal fat by markedly decreasing the levels of lipid droplets (LD) and perilipin 1 protein and Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) expression.

Diverse bacteria and fungi inhabiting extremely radioactive waste and disaster sites (e.g. Hanford, Chernobyl, Fukushima) represent new targets of CIR research. We show that many microorganisms can grow under intense gamma-CIR dose rates of 13-126 Gy/h, with fungi identified as a particularly CIR-resistant group of eukaryotes: among 145 phylogenetically diverse strains tested, 78 grew under 36 Gy/h. Importantly, we demonstrate that CIR resistance can depend on cell concentration and that certain resistant microbial cells protect their neighbors (not only conspecifics, but even radiosensitive species from a different phylum), from high-level CIR. We apply a mechanistically-motivated mathematical model of CIR effects, based on accumulation/removal kinetics of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, in bacteria (3 Escherichia coli strains and Deinococcus radiodurans) and in fungi (Candida parapsilosis, Kazachstania exigua, Pichia kudriavzevii, Rhodotorula lysinophila, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon mucoides). We also show that correlations between responses to CIR and acute ionizing radiation (AIR) among studied microorganisms are weak. For example, in D. radiodurans, the best molecular correlate for CIR resistance is the antioxidant enzyme catalase, which is dispensable for AIR resistance; and numerous CIR-resistant fungi are not AIR-resistant. Our experimental findings and quantitative modeling thus demonstrate the importance of investigating CIR responses directly, rather than extrapolating from AIR.

Activation of caspases, Bcl-2 family proteins, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-induced hepatocyte apoptosis plays a role in the activation of NAFLD/NASH. Apoptotic hepatocytes stimulate immune cells and hepatic stellate cells toward the progression of fibrosis in the liver through the production of inflammasomes and cytokines.

Consequently, the host may be rendered susceptible to colonization by a pathogen. This is a particularly relevant concern in the hospital setting, where antibiotic use and antibiotic-resistant pathogen exposure are more frequent. Many nosocomial infections arise from gastrointestinal colonization. Due to their resistance to antibiotics, treatment is often very challenging.

Impaired epithelial transport (ion, nutrient, or drugs) has been associated with many diseases and can have consequences that extend beyond the normal physiological functions of the transporters, such as by influencing epithelial integrity and the gut microbiome. Understanding the function and regulation of transport proteins is critical for the development of improved therapeutic interventions. The biggest challenge in the study of epithelial transport is developing a suitable model system that recapitulates important features of the native intestinal epithelial cells. Several in vitro cell culture models, such as Caco-2, T-84, and HT-29-Cl.19A cells are typically used in epithelial transport research. These cell lines represent a reductionist approach to modeling the epithelium and have been used in many mechanistic studies, including their examination of epithelial-microbial interactions. However, cell monolayers do not accurately reflect cell-cell interactions and the in vivo microenvironment. Cells grown in 3D have shown to be promising models for drug permeability studies. We show that Caco-2 cells in 3D can be used to study epithelial transporters. It is also important that studies in Caco-2 cells are complemented with other models to rule out cell specific effects and to take into account the complexity of the native intestine. Several methods have been previously used to assess the functionality of transporters, such as everted sac and uptake in isolated epithelial cells or in isolated plasma membrane vesicles.

Several recent studies have demonstrated that commensal microbes influence systemic immune function and homeostasis. For patients with extramucosal cancers, or cancers occurring distal to barrier surfaces, the role of commensal microbes in influencing tumor progression is beginning to be appreciated. Extrinsic factors such as chronic inflammation, antibiotics, and chemotherapy dysregulate commensal homeostasis and drive tumor-promoting systemic inflammation through a variety of mechanisms, including disruption of barrier function and bacterial translocation, release of soluble inflammatory mediators, and systemic changes in metabolic output. Conversely, it has also been demonstrated that certain immune therapies, immunogenic chemotherapies, and checkpoint inhibitors rely on the commensal microbiota to facilitate anti-tumor immune responses. Thus, it is evident that the mechanisms associated with commensal microbe facilitation of both pro- and anti-tumor immune responses are context dependent and rely upon a variety of factors present within the tumor microenvironment and systemic periphery.

The aim of this research was to confirm whether a combination of quercetin and resveratrol (CQR) could restore the gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). In this study, Wistar rats were divided into three groups: a normal diet (ND) group, a HFD group and a CQR group. The CQR group was treated with a HFD and administered with a combination of quercetin [30 mg per kg body weight (BW) per day] and resveratrol [15 mg per kg body weight (BW) per day] by oral gavage.

Given its role in metabolic regulation, the gastrointestinal tract constitutes a meaningful target to treat T2DM, especially in light of accumulating evidence that surgery with gastrointestinal manipulations may result in T2DM remission (metabolic surgery). The major mechanisms mediating the weight loss-independent effects of bariatric surgery comprise effects on tissue-specific insulin sensitivity, \u03b2-cell function and incretin responses, changes in bile acid composition and flow, modifications of gut microbiota, intestinal glucose metabolism and increased brown adipose tissue metabolic activity. Shorter T2DM duration, better preoperative glycemic control and profound weight loss, have been associated with higher rates of T2DM remission and lower risk of relapse. In the short and medium term, a significant amount of weight is lost, T2DM may completely regress, and cardiometabolic risk factors are dramatically improved.

Cross-sectional samples suggested a progression of the lower airways microbiome with age, beginning with relatively sterile airways in infancy. By age two, bacterial sequences typically associated with the oral cavity dominated lower airways samples in many CF subjects. The presence of an oral-like lower airways microbiome correlated with a significant increase in bacterial density and inflammation. These early changes occurred in many patients, despite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in our cohort during the first two years of life. The majority of CF subjects older than four harbored a pathogen dominated airway microbiome, which was associated with a further increase in inflammation and the onset of structural lung disease, despite a negligible increase in bacterial density compared to younger patients with an oral-like airway microbiome.

This is associated with the development of geriatric syndromes including sarcopenia and frailty. Dietary protein is essential for skeletal muscle function. Resistance exercise appears to be the most beneficial form of physical activity for preserving skeletal muscle and a synergistic effect has been noted when this is combined with dietary protein. However, older adults have shown evidence of anabolic resistance, where greater amounts of protein are required to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and response is variable. Thus, the recommended daily amount of protein is greater for older people. The aetiologies and mechanisms responsible for anabolic resistance are not fully understood. The gut microbiota is implicated in many of the postulated mechanisms for anabolic resistance, either directly or indirectly. The gut microbiota change with age, and are influenced by dietary protein. Research also implies a role for the gut microbiome in skeletal muscle function.

Bioavailability and activity of polyphenols depend on foods' structure and interactions with other food constituents, especially proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Polyphenols-proteins interactions can result in various biological effects, such as sense of astringency. So far, polyphenols interactions with food lipids have not been of special importance, except in case of plant oils. Polyphenols-carbohydrates interactions can influence the organoleptic properties, while interactions with dietary fibers are particularly significant. Polyphenols can decrease the synthesis of fats and fatty acids in the liver, or delay their absorption in intestines. Also, polyphenols can slow down digestion of carbohydrates, through the inhibition of digestive enzymes or modulation of glucose uptake. Both animal and plant proteins have low impact on the bioavailability of polyphenols, but some in vitro studies reported that milk proteins could enhance intestinal absorption of polyphenols from tea. Dietary fats may alter the passage of polyphenols through gastrointestinal tract and impact absorption of more hydrophobic polyphenols in particular. While some studies reported that associations with carbohydrates could decrease bioavailability of polyphenols, the others showed the opposite effects. Macronutrients can be used for encapsulation of polyphenols, which can increase their bioavailability and ensure controlled and targeted release. Polyphenols' interactions in the body include their incorporation in cell membranes which causes changes in fatty acid profile and impacts membrane-bound transporters and enzymes.

Using healthy controls as a baseline (n\u2009=\u200916), we demonstrate that a trend in the nature and directionality of the metabolic changes exists according to the type of the disease. The impact on the gut microbial activity, and thus the metabolite composition and metabolic flux of gut microbes, is therefore disease-dependent. Our data further provide experimental evidence that HIV infection drastically changed the microbial community, and the species responsible for the metabolism of 4 amino acids, in contrast to patients with the other two diseases and healthy controls.

Studies of its interactions with mammalian tissues have been hampered by the fact that C.\u00a0difficile requires anaerobic conditions to survive after spore germination. We recently developed a bioengineered 3D human intestinal tissue model and found that low O<sub>2</sub> conditions are produced in the lumen of these tissues. Here, we compared the ability of C.\u00a0difficile spores to germinate, produce toxin and cause tissue damage in our bioengineered 3D tissue model versus in a 2D transwell model in which human cells form a polarized monolayer. 3D tissue models or 2D polarized monolayers on transwell filters were challenged with the non-toxin producing C.\u00a0difficile CCUG 37787 serotype X (ATCC 43603) and the toxin producing UK1 C.\u00a0difficile spores in the presence of the germinant, taurocholate. Spores germinated in both the 3D tissue model as well as the 2D transwell system, however toxin activity was significantly higher in the 3D tissue models compared to the 2D transwells. Moreover, the epithelium damage in the 3D tissue model was significantly more severe than in 2D transwells and damage correlated significantly with the level of toxin activity detected but not with the amount of germinated spores. Combined, these results show that the bioengineered 3D tissue model provides a powerful system with which to study early events leading to toxin production and tissue damage of C.\u00a0difficile with mammalian cells under anaerobic conditions.

The T cell immunoglobulin mucin proteins constitute a family that modulates immune tolerance by limiting the survival of immune effector cells, clearing apoptotic bodies, and expanding the population of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

It is proposed, based on the human pharmacokinetics of EPAC, that the biliary excretion of M9, the most abundant metabolite, leads to the enterohepatic circulation of EPAC. Using various in vitro systems, we evaluated in the present study the vitro interactions of EPAC and its major metabolites with major drug transporters involved in drug absorption and disposition. EPAC is a substrate for efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), but it is not a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters [organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3]. The low permeability of M9 suggests an essential role for transporters in its disposition. M9 is likely excreted from hepatocytes into bile via multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and BCRP, excreted into blood via MRP3, and transported from blood back into hepatocytes via OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.

There is growing evidence that vitamin D signaling has impacts on all these aspects of intestinal physiology, contributing to healthy enteric homeostasis. VD was first discovered as the curative agent for nutritional rickets, and its classical actions are associated with calcium absorption and bone health. However, vitamin D exhibits a number of extra-skeletal effects, particularly in innate immunity.

These organisms express cell surface serine-rich repeat adhesins containing \"Siglec-like\" binding regions (SLBRs) that mediate attachment to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids on human glycoproteins. Two known receptors for the Siglec-like adhesins are the salivary mucin MG2/MUC7 and platelet GPIb\u03b1, and the interaction of streptococci with these targets may contribute to oral colonization and endocarditis, respectively. The SLBRs display a surprising diversity of preferences for defined glycans, ranging from highly selective to broader specificity. In this report, we characterize the glycoproteins in human plasma recognized by four SLBRs that prefer different \u03b12-3 sialoglycan structures. We found that the SLBRs recognize a surprisingly small subset of plasma proteins that are extensively O-glycosylated. The preferred plasma protein ligands for a sialyl-T antigen-selective SLBR are proteoglycan 4 (lubricin) and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4. Conversely, the preferred ligand for a 3'sialyllactosamine-selective SLBR is glycocalicin (the extracellular portion of platelet GPIb\u03b1). All four SLBRs recognize C1 inhibitor but detect distinctly different glycoforms of this key regulator of the complement and kallikrein protease cascades. The four plasma ligands have potential roles in thrombosis and inflammation, and each has been cited as a biomarker for one or more vascular or other diseases.

This review summarizes recent research on the vaginal ecosystem, the Lactobacillus species that dominate it, and the means by which they suppress the growth, development, and/or proliferation of pathogenic microbial species. Lactobacilli colonization is believed to be beneficial since it prevents other microorganisms from colonizing the vaginal epithelium via competitive adhesion, interactions with the local immunity and plasminogen-plasmin system, and the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and antibacterial substances.

By selectively engineering three PB1 and PA mutations into the parental CA/07 strain, we demonstrated that these mutations in polymerase subunits decreased the production of defective viral genome segments with internal deletions and dramatically increased the release of infectious virions from mouse cells.

Some studies demonstrated that saturated fatty acids (SFA) are considered detrimental for treating these disorders. A high fat diet rich in palmitic acid, a SFA, is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and it may also increase atherosclerosis parameters.

Taking this into consideration, the aim of this contribution is to review the impact of HFD on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology before and after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications. Evidence from animal studies suggest that before the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications, HFD induces intestinal dysbiosis - encompassing changes in composition balance and massive redistribution with bacteria occupying intervillous spaces and crypts - associated with early physiopathological changes, predominantly in the ileum, such as low-grade inflammation, decreased antimicrobial peptides expression, impaired mucus production, secretion and layer's thickness, and decreased expression of tight junction proteins. With time, major inflammatory signals (e.g. toll-like receptor-4 dependent) become activated, thereby stimulating proinflammatory cytokines secretion in the small intestine. This inflammatory state might subsequently exacerbate disruption of the mucus layer barrier and increase epithelial permeability of the small intestine, thereby creating an environment that facilitates the passage of bacterial components (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and flagellin) and metabolites from the intestinal lumen (e.g. secondary bile acids) to the circulation and peripheral tissues (i.e. leaky gut), eventually promoting the development of systemic inflammation, obesity, adiposity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance preceding hyperglycemia.

In this work, the aim was to perform a critical analysis of the literature available concerning antibacterial biomaterials for oral implantology and to provide a practical derivation for such a purpose. As anti-adhesive strategies may affect osseointegration, they should no longer be recommended for inclusion in this class of biomaterials, despite promising results in biomedical engineering for other, non-bone load bearing organs. Targeted, antibacterial drug delivery is most likely desirable in the case of intraosseous implants. Interfering factors such as the oral cavity environment, saliva, the bacterial microbiome, as well as, the characteristics of the alveolar mucosa and peri-implant space must be taken into account when calculating the local pharmacokinetics for antibacterial coatings. Effective release is crucial for tailoring antibacterial implant longevity providing minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the desired amount of time, which for oral implants, should be at least the cumulative time for the osseointegration period and functional loading period within the tissues. These parameters may differ between the implant type and its anatomical site. Also, the functional drug concentration in the peri-implant space should be calculated as the amount of the drug released from the implant surface including the concentration of the drug inactivated by biological fluids of the peri-implant space or saliva flow throughout the effective release time.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Drug delivery"}, {"PMID": 29029638, "Abstract": "The limited understanding of microbial characteristics in moisture-damaged buildings impedes efforts to clarify which adverse health effects in the occupants are associated with the damage and to develop effective building intervention strategies.

We used one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for RNA samples to screen for the KIF5B-MET fusion in 206 lung adenocarcinoma and 28 pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma patients. Genomic breakpoints of KIF5B-MET were determined by targeted next-generation sequencing. Soft agar colony formation assays, proliferation assays, and a xenograft mouse model were used to investigate its oncogenic activity. In addition, specific MET inhibitors were administered to evaluate their anti-tumor activities. A KIF5B-MET fusion variant in a patient with a mixed-type adenocarcinoma and sarcomatoid tumor was identified, and another case was found in a pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma patient. Both cases carried the same chimeric gene, a fusion between exons 1-24 of KIF5B and exons 15-21 of MET. KIF5B-MET-overexpressing cells exhibited significantly increased proliferation and colony-forming ability. Xenograft tumors harboring the fusion gene demonstrated significantly elevated tumor growth. Ectopic expression of the fusion gene stimulated the phosphorylation of KIF5B-MET as well as downstream STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The MET inhibitors significantly repressed cell proliferation; phosphorylation of downstream STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2; and xenograft tumorigenicity.

Recent studies from animal models and clinical trials suggest promising effects of this method in treating patients with IBD, but more studies are urgently needed to confirm its efficacy and safety, since the etiology of this chronic inflammatory disease is not fully understood and caution should be taken when transplanting fecal matters between individuals which might transfer other infectious organisms and diseases.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology"}, {"PMID": 28661940, "Abstract": "Brain-gut-microbiota interactions may play an important role in human health and behavior.

The proteins in free saliva or in the mucosal pellicle contribute to flavor perception by interacting with or metabolizing flavor compounds. Most of these reactions were observed when using fresh whole saliva; however, they were absent or less frequently observed when using artificial saliva or depleted/frozen whole saliva. There is a need to better understand the role of protein aggregates in flavor perception. Within humans, there is great interindividual variation in salivary composition, which has been related to differences in flavor perception.

A number of phage therapy phase I and II clinical trials have concluded, and shown phages don't present significant adverse safety concerns. These clinical trials used simple phage suspensions without any formulation and phage stability was of secondary concern. Phages have a limited stability in solution, and undergo a significant drop in phage titre during processing and storage which is unacceptable if phages are to become regulated pharmaceuticals, where stable dosage and well defined pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are de rigueur. Animal studies have shown that the efficacy of phage therapy outcomes depend on the phage concentration (i.e. the dose) delivered at the site of infection, and their ability to target and kill bacteria, arresting bacterial growth and clearing the infection. In addition, in vitro and animal studies have shown the importance of using phage cocktails rather than single phage preparations to achieve better therapy outcomes. The in vivo reduction of phage concentration due to interactions with host antibodies or other clearance mechanisms may necessitate repeated dosing of phages, or sustained release approaches. Modelling of phage-bacterium population dynamics reinforces these points. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the effect of formulation on phage therapy outcomes, given the need for phage cocktails, where each phage within a cocktail may require significantly different formulation to retain a high enough infective dose. This review firstly looks at the clinical needs and challenges (informed through a review of key animal studies evaluating phage therapy) associated with treatment of acute and chronic infections and the drivers for phage encapsulation. An important driver for formulation and encapsulation is shelf life and storage of phage to ensure reproducible dosages. Other drivers include formulation of phage for encapsulation in micro- and nanoparticles for effective delivery, encapsulation in stimuli responsive systems for triggered controlled or sustained release at the targeted site of infection. Encapsulation of phage (e.g. in liposomes) may also be used to increase the circulation time of phage for treating systemic infections, for prophylactic treatment or to treat intracellular infections. We then proceed to document approaches used in the published literature on the formulation and stabilisation of phage for storage and encapsulation of bacteriophage in micro- and nanostructured materials using freeze drying (lyophilization), spray drying, in emulsions e.g. ointments, polymeric microparticles, nanoparticles and liposomes. As phage therapy moves forward towards Phase III clinical trials, the review concludes by looking at promising new approaches for micro- and nanoencapsulation of phages and how these may address gaps in the field.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Advances in colloid and interface science"}, {"PMID": 27810411, "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death and archetype for cancer as a genetic disease. However, the mechanisms for genetic change and their interactions with environmental risk factors have been difficult to unravel. New hypotheses, models, and methods are being used to investigate a complex web of risk factors that includes the intestinal microbiome. Recent research has clarified how the microbiome can generate genomic change in CRC. Several phenotypes among a small group of selected commensals have helped us better understand how mutations and chromosomal instability (CIN) are induced in CRC (e.g., toxin production, metabolite formation, radical generation, and immune modulation leading to a bystander effect). This review discusses recent hypotheses, models, and mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome contributes to the initiation and progression of sporadic and colitis-associated forms of CRC. Overall, it appears the microbiome can initiate and/or promote CRC at all stages of tumorigenesis by acting as an inducer of DNA damage and CIN, regulating cell growth and death, generating epigenetic changes, and modulating host immune responses.

In this study, we analyze epidemiological, clinical, microbiological and laboratory data from patients with r-CDI, relapse, and reinfection-CDI over 5 years and compared with a control group (non r-CDI). Among 60 patients with r-CDI, 36 patients had stool samples collected from two or more episodes, which were molecularly analyzed. Based on ribotyping, 63.9% of the samples were relapse, and 36.1% reinfection. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, previous antibiotic exposure was found to be a risk factor for r-CDI (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.0-4.9; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Patients with relapse had previous antibiotic exposure more frequently than did patients with reinfection (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and patients with reinfection suffered more frequently from chronic liver disease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) than did relapse patients. Relapse patients compared with the control group had a higher percentage of previous antibiotic exposure, although the difference was statistically no significant (73.9% vs. 91.3 p\u00a0=\u00a00.06). No significant differences for the selected variables were observed between the reinfection and control groups, although we observed a higher percentage of patients with chronic liver disease (30.8% vs 13.3%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.08).

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the intestinal protective effect of CMP in 5-FU-treated CT26 tumour-bearing mice and to further explore its underlying mechanism(s) of action. Initially, a CT26 colon carcinoma xenograft mice model was established. The colon length, colon tissue injury, intestinal flora, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and indicators linked to inflammation, antioxidation and apoptosis were then measured. Our results showed that CMP in combination with 5-FU reversed intestinal shortening (p < 0.01) and alleviated 5-FU-induced colon injury (p < 0.001) via suppression of ROS production; increasing the levels of CAT, GSH-Px and GSH; decreasing expression of NF-\u03baB, p-p38 and Bax; and elevating the levels of Nrf2 and Bcl-2. More importantly, CMP had a significant impact and counteracted the intestinal microflora disorders produced by 5-FU by increasing the proportion of Bacteroidetes, lactobacilli, and butyric acid-producing and acetic acid-producing bacteria and restoring the intestinal flora diversity. Overall, this work suggested that CMP could regulate the ecological balance of the intestinal flora and reduce colon injuries induced by 5-FU in CT26 tumour-bearing mice, and the mechanism involved may be associated with the regulation of the NF-\u03baB, Nrf2-ARE and MAPK/P38 pathways.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Food & function"}, {"PMID": 28677765, "Abstract": "Periodontitis is an oral chronic inflammatory disease induced by microorganisms that can destroy tooth\u2011supporting structures.

This raises the question whether the increased incidence of allergies, asthma, some autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and others might relate to intake of unhealthy foods, and the decreased intake of dietary fiber. In recent years, new knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underpinning a 'diet-gut microbiota-physiology axis' has emerged to substantiate this idea. Fiber is fermented to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly acetate, butyrate, and propionate. These metabolites bind 'metabolite-sensing' G-protein-coupled receptors such as GPR43, GPR41, and GPR109A. These receptors play fundamental roles in the promotion of gut homeostasis and the regulation of inflammatory responses. For instance, these receptors and their metabolites influence Treg biology, epithelial integrity, gut homeostasis, DC biology, and IgA antibody responses. The SCFAs also influence gene transcription in many cells and tissues, through their inhibition of histone deacetylase expression or function. Contained in this mix is the gut microbiome, as commensal bacteria in the gut have the necessary enzymes to digest dietary fiber to SCFAs, and dysbiosis in the gut may affect the production of SCFAs and their distribution to tissues throughout the body. SCFAs can epigenetically modify DNA, and so may be one mechanism to account for diseases with a 'developmental origin', whereby in utero or post-natal exposure to environmental factors (such as nutrition of the mother) may account for disease later in life.

Aberrant NO pathways are implicated in a number of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease. The mechanism of NO in oxidative and nitrosative stress with pathological consequences involves reactions with reactive oxygen species (e.g., superoxide) to form the highly reactive peroxynitrite, hydrogen peroxide, hypochloride ions and hydroxyl radical. NO levels are typically regulated by endogenous nitric oxide synthases (NOS), and inflammatory iNOS is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, in which elevated NO mediates axonal degeneration and activates cyclooxygenases to provoke neuroinflammation. NO also instigates a down-regulated secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is essential for neuronal survival, development and differentiation, synaptogenesis, and learning and memory. The gut-brain axis denotes communication between the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the GI tract and the central nervous system (CNS) of the brain, and the modes of communication include the vagus nerve, passive diffusion and carrier by oxyhemoglobin.

Over the last decade considerable insights have been made into the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in cognitive function and the cellular mechanisms behind this process. Additionally, an increasing amount of evidence exists on the impact of environmental factors, such as stress and neuroinflammation on hippocampal neurogenesis and subsequent impairments in cognition. Elevated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in the hippocampus is established as a significant contributor to the neuronal demise evident in many neurological and psychiatric disorders and is now known to negatively regulate hippocampal neurogenesis. In order to prevent the deleterious effects of IL-1\u03b2 on neurogenesis it is necessary to identify signalling pathways and regulators of neurogenesis within neural progenitor cells that can interact with IL-1\u03b2.

The sputa microbiota of COPD patients was evaluated when clinically stable and during acute exacerbations of the disease. Sputa microbiota was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based pathogen detection. Nine COPD patients were enrolled. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes identified 2,267 unique bacterial operational taxonomic units. Principal microbiota shifts during exacerbation were in either Proteobacteria, Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes. Streptococcus and Moraxella levels were detected during exacerbation in severe (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 3) COPD patients. Most of the clinically-important genera found in the sputum with the pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene correlated with specific quantitative polymerase chain reactions for bacteria while respiratory viruses were nearly absent. Sputum microbiotas of exacerbated COPD patients are complex. This pilot study shows a clear shift in the microbiota of patients during exacerbation. The nature of this shift varies from patient to patient in such a way that the treatment should be patient-specific. Further studies are needed to establish the impact of microbial exacerbations on the pulmonary microbiota.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "PloS one"}, {"PMID": 27900260, "Abstract": "Changes to the microbial community in the human gut have been proposed to promote metabolic disturbances that also occur after short periods of sleep loss (including insulin resistance).

These bacterial communities may originate from the mouth and nasopharynx or from the environment by inhalation. The microbial composition of the lower airways may be modulated by dietary factors, antibiotic therapy, and microbial infections, particularly in early life. In addition, circulatory products from gut microbiota may influence the lung microbiota to maintain mucosal immunity. Recent studies have revealed that, in asthma, the lower airway microbiota show reduced diversity and community composition that is linked to severity and inflammatory phenotype. There is also a greater prevalence of proteobacteria, including Haemophilus, in symptomatic asthma. Microbial dysbiosis may contribute to both the inception and progression of asthma in infants and children, and to corticosteroid resistance in asthma. A better understanding of the regulation of the lung and gut microbiota in asthma may pave the way for targeting microbiota to prevent and treat asthma.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Annals of the American Thoracic Society"}, {"PMID": 29631890, "Abstract": "The intestinal microbiota is essential for digestion, the production of physiological metabolites, and defense. More than 10<sup>13</sup> bacteria are present in the intestine, inspiring awe as well as fear of potential infections. By definition, the immune system protects us from infection, and is given the task to recognize dangerous pathogens from useful mutualists. Nevertheless, the definition of pathogens and mutualists is often contextual, and the immune system reacts to all types of microbes. In fact, immune reactivity to microbiota is necessary for the development of the immune system. If the host-microbe cross-talk is perturbed before birth or weaning, the immune system develops \"pathological imprinting\" and increased susceptibility to inflammatory pathology later in life. Reactivity to microbiota is also important in adulthood to regulate immune responses and maintain homeostasis.", "Year": 2018, "Journal": "Comptes rendus biologies"}]
