We identified 7 species of bacteria previously known to contribute to nitrate-reduction, the most prevalent of which were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella dispar. Following dietary nitrate supplementation, blood pressure was reduced and salivary and plasma nitrate and nitrite increased substantially. We found that the abundance of nitrate-reducing bacteria was associated with the generation of salivary nitrite but not with any other measured variable. To examine the impact of bacterial abundance on pharmacokinetics we also categorised our participants into two groups; those with a higher abundance of nitrate reducing bacteria (> 50%), and those with a lower abundance (< 50%). Salivary nitrite production was lower in participants with lower abundance of bacteria and these individuals also exhibited slower salivary nitrite pharmacokinetics. We therefore show that the rate of nitrate to nitrite reduction in the oral cavity is associated with the abundance of nitrate-reducing bacteria. Nevertheless, higher abundance of these bacteria did not result in an exaggerated plasma nitrite response, the best known marker of NO bioavailability.

This impairment was associated with enhanced interaction of LCK with SHP-1 after TCR engagement and rapid termination of TCR signals, a defect corrected by TAOK3 reconstitution.

Overall, a picture emerged of tumor heterogeneity as the main limitation that impairs the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies. Thus, the choice of a specific therapy based on reproducible and selective predictive biomarkers is an urgent unmet clinical need that should be addressed in order to increase the proportion of long-term responding patients and to improve the sustainability of novel drugs.", "Year": 2019, "Journal": "Cytokine & growth factor reviews"}, {"PMID": 30669612, "Abstract": "The population is now living longer during the period classified as \"elderly\" (60 years and older), exhibiting multimorbidity associated to the lengthening of the average life span.

The protective role of human milk is well known although the mechanisms behind it still need to be uncovered. This study aimed to characterize the impact of human milk in the immature intestine of newborns by analyzing the global transcriptomic response of the FHs 74 int cell line (ATCC CCL-241). The expression of intestinal keratins and other genes with a well-annotated intestinal or epithelial function validated FHs 74 int derived from the fetal small intestine as a model of the intestinal epithelium of newborns. Cells exposed to skimmed human milk showed seventeen differentially expressed genes, most of them up-regulated, including four chemokine genes (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL10) and other immune-related genes. qRT-PCR and ELISA analysis confirmed the microarray data and indicated a different pattern of expression upon milk exposure in FHs 74 int as compared to the adult tumorigenic Caco-2 cell line.

We observed strong contractions of longitudinal visceral muscle fibers for the first 2 hours following bacterial ingestion. We showed that these visceral muscle contractions are induced by immune reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate in the lumen and depend on the ROS-sensing TRPA1 receptor. We then demonstrate that both ROS and TRPA1 are required in a subset of anterior enteroendocrine cells for the release of the DH31 neuropeptide which activates its receptor in the neighboring visceral muscles. The resulting contractions of the visceral muscles favors quick expulsion of the bacteria, limiting their presence in the gut. Our results unveil a precocious mechanism of defense against ingested opportunistic bacteria, whether they are Gram-positive like Bacillus thuringiensis or Gram-negative like Erwinia carotovora carotovora.

A significant increase in cell proliferation was detectable 5 days postadministration of B. breve UCC2003. Using advanced functional genomic approaches, bacterial strains either (a) producing the Tad<sub>2003</sub> pili or (b) lacking the TadE or TadF pseudopilins were created. Analysis of the ability of these mutant strains to promote epithelial cell proliferation in vivo demonstrated that the pilin subunit, TadE, is the bifidobacterial molecule responsible for this proliferation response. These findings were confirmed in vitro using purified TadE protein. Our data imply that bifidobacterial Tad pili may contribute to the maturation of the na\u00efve gut in early life through the production of a specific scaffold of extracellular protein structures, which stimulate growth of the neonatal mucosa.", "Year": 2019, "Journal": "Molecular microbiology"}, {"PMID": 30908479, "Abstract": "We present a nonlinear programming (NLP) framework for the scalable solution of parameter estimation problems that arise in dynamic modeling of biological systems. Such problems are computationally challenging because they often involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations as well as many experimental data sets and parameters. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge modeling and solution tools which are computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. Specifically, our framework uses a time discretization approach that: i) avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, ii) enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and iii) enables the use of computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. We demonstrate these capabilities by solving estimation problems for synthetic human gut microbiome community models. We show that an instance with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 experimental data points can be solved in less than 3 minutes using our proposed framework (while an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework requires over 7 hours). We also create large instances to show that the proposed framework is scalable and can solve problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The proposed framework is flexible and easy-to-use, can be broadly applied to dynamic models of biological systems, and enables the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, to diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, to perform model selection, and to handle outliers.", "Year": 2019, "Journal": "PLoS computational biology"}, {"PMID": 30172257, "Abstract": "Host-microbe balance maintains intestinal homeostasis and strongly influences inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

Moreover, increasing evidence supports the role of the microbiome and microbiota-derived molecules in regulating such interactions; however, the mechanisms underpinning such effects are only beginning to be resolved. Microbiota-gut peptide interactions are poised to be of great significance in the regulation of gut-brain signaling. Given the emerging role of the gut-brain axis in a variety of brain disorders, such as anxiety and depression, it is important to understand the contribution of bidirectional interactions between peptide hormones released from the gut and intestinal bacteria in the context of this axis. Indeed, the gastrointestinal tract is the largest endocrine organ in mammals, secreting dozens of different signaling molecules, including peptides. Gut peptides in the systemic circulation can bind cognate receptors on immune cells and vagus nerve terminals thereby enabling indirect gut-brain communication. Gut peptide concentrations are not only modulated by enteric microbiota signals, but also vary according to the composition of the intestinal microbiota.

Recent emphasis has also been placed on the concept of the holobiome which states that no single aspect of an organism should be viewed separately and thus must include examination of their associated microbial populations and their influence. While it is known that the microbiome may be involved in the modulation of animal behaviour, there has been little systematized effort to incorporate into such studies the rapidly developing knowledge of the wide range of olfactory systems. The classical olfactory system is evolutionarily conserved in multiple taxa from insects through to fish, reptiles and mammals, and is represented by the largest gene families in vertebrates. Mice have over 1000 different olfactory receptors and humans about 400. They are distributed throughout the body and are even found in spermatozoa where they function in chemotaxis. Each olfactory receptor has the unique functional capability of high-affinity binding to several different molecular ligands. These and other properties render the cataloguing of odorants (odorome) with specific actions a difficult task. Some ectopic olfactory receptors have been shown to have functional effects in the gut and kidney, highlighting the complexity of the systems engaged by odorants. However, there are, in addition to classical olfactory receptors, at least two other families of receptors involved in olfaction that are also widely found expressed on tissues in many different organs in addition to the nervous system and brain: the trace-amine associated and formyl peptide receptors. Bacteria can make many if not most odorants and are responsible for recognition of species and relative relatedness, as well as predator presence, among many other examples. Activation of different combinations of olfactory receptors by bacterial products such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine have been shown even to control expression of emotions such as fear and aggression. The number of examples of bacterial products and volatile odorants influencing brain function and behaviour is expanding rapidly. Since it is recognized that many different bacterial products and metabolites also function as social cues, and may themselves be directly or indirectly causative of behavioural change, it becomes ever more important to include olfaction into studies of the MGBA. Clearly there are broader implications for the involvement of olfaction in this rapidly evolving field.

Lactobacilli represent the dominant bacterial species able to prevent facultative and obligate anaerobes outnumber in vaginal microbiota maintaining healthy microbial homeostasis. Several mechanisms underlie the protection exerted by lactobacilli: competition for nutrients and tissue adherence, reduction of the vaginal pH, modulation of immunity, and production of bioactive compounds. Among bioactive factors of cervicovaginal mucosa, lactoferrin, an iron-binding cationic glycoprotein, is a multifunctional glycoprotein with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic activities, recently emerging as an important modulator of inflammation. Lactobacilli and lactoferrin are largely under the influence of female hormones and of paracrine production of various cytokines. Lactoferrin is strongly increased in lower genital tract mucosal fluid of women affected by <i>Neisseria gonorrheae, Chlamydia trachomatis</i>, and <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i> infections promoting both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaginal dysbiosis characterized by low amounts of vaginal lactobacilli and increased levels of endogenous anaerobic bacteria, the increase in lactoferrin could act as an immune modulator assuming the role normally played by the healthy microbiota in vaginal mucosa.

When the infant is born, the immature gastrointestinal tract is exposed to milk and simultaneously colonized by high densities of bacteria. The combination of milk, microbiota and an immature gut, leaves the infant vulnerable to developing the dreaded intestinal emergency necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is often very aggressive and no cure exists, which means that prevention is an utmost important topic to researchers, physicians, parents - and infants. \u00a0 Despite immense research during the last decades, no specific test to determine if an infant suffers from NEC exists. Most neonatal units use Bell's staging criteria, which are based on clinical and radiographic findings, as a diagnostic tool; however the diagnosis given according to Bell's stages has not been validated. In study I, we aimed to determine the validity of the NEC diagnosis given at discharge. An expert panel consisting of a neonatologist, a paediatric surgeon and a paediatric radiologist served as the golden standard. We found that the diagnosis given at discharge had a poor validity which significantly affected the reported incidence of NEC in the neonatal department at Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The validity of the NEC diagnosis was worse than the validity of most other paediatric diagnoses that had been investigated. \u00a0 In studies II and III, we aimed to explore possible means of NEC prevention. The role of nutrition in NEC development is well established with mother's milk as the best option to avoid NEC in the preterm infant. Maternal milk is, however, most often not available in sufficient amounts during the first days of life, and preterm infant formula or human donor milk is used in its absence. Studies in preterm piglets showed that bovine colostrum equally to human donor milk protected against NEC compared to infant formula. Furthermore, bovine colostrum was superior to human donor milk in stimulating gut immunity and digestive functions. \u00a0 Hence, in study II we aimed to design a pilot study of bovine colostrum used as a supplement to maternal milk in the first days of life and to determine if the study was feasible. In the paper, we present the protocol and the results of the first two phases of the Precolos study in which 12 infants were included and received pasteurized, spray-dried and reconstituted bovine colostrum during the first days of life as the first infants in the world. We found that the infants tolerated bovine colostrum without clinical adverse effects, but we also observed a transient hypertyrosinemia on day seven of life in five infants. The results were evaluated by a safety management board which encouraged us to continue the pilot study with the last phase, which was a randomized controlled trial of 20+20 infants comparing supplementation with bovine colostrum to supplementation with standard nutrition. The randomized trial has just finished recruitment. \u00a0 At last, we wanted to shed light on a possible microbiological angle of NEC prevention. Dysbiosis and bacterial translocation are believed to play a crucial role in the development of NEC as intestinal pneumatosis, which occurs when bacteria produce gas inside the intestinal wall, is a pathognomonic radiographic finding. In a quality improvement study from the US published in 2014, NEC incidence was significantly reduced after the implementation of several quality improvement interventions. Standardized weekly exchange of nasogastric feeding tubes was suggested as one of the potential NEC-reducing interventions. \u00a0 In the neonatal unit at Rigshospitalet, Denmark, preterm infants are fed 8-12 times daily through a resident nasogastric feeding tube which is exposed to body temperature, contains milk residuals from the last meal and is handled by both parents and personnel. Since bacterial pollution of milk given through the nasogastric feeding tube might be NEC-inducing, we aimed in study III to determine the bacterial load given to the infants when feeding them through a tube. We collected 92 used nasogastric feeding tubes and flushed them with one ml saline each to imitate a meal given through them. Eighty-nine percent of the tubes contaminated the meals with more than 1000 colony-forming units of bacteria and fifty-five percent contaminated the meals with the possible pathogens Enterobacteriaceae or Staphylococcus aureus. The concentration of bacteria in the saline flushed through the tubes was as high as 109 colony-forming units per ml; however, neither the risk of contamination nor the concentration of bacteria in the flush was associated with the duration of use. Implementation of standardized weekly exchange of feeding tubes would therefore not prevent the contamination of meals. \u00a0 In conclusion, the studies included in this thesis serve as a base for future studies investigating the prevention of NEC. We found a poor validity of the NEC diagnosis given at discharge. This should be kept in mind when conducting epidemiological studies of NEC and especially when conducting interventional trials with NEC as an outcome. If the findings of the randomized part of the Precolos study indicate a positive effect of bovine colostrum and do not give rise to concerns regarding feasibility, safety or tolerability, a large-scale randomized controlled study with NEC as the primary outcome will be planned. Based on the high concentrations of bacteria found in the nasogastric feeding tubes, a randomized controlled trial investigating whether the frequency of feeding tube exchange affects the early colonization has been commenced in the neonatal department at Rigshospitalet.

Ascendency of resistant variants threatens the efficacy of most, if not all, of the antimicrobial drugs commonly used to prevent and/or cure microbial infections. Resistant phenotype is very common in enteric bacteria. The most common mechanisms of AMR are enzymatic modifications to the antimicrobials or their target molecules. In enteric bacteria, most of the resistance traits are acquired by horizontal gene transfer from closely or distantly related bacterial population. AMR traits are generally linked with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and could rapidly disseminate to the bacterial species through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from a pool of resistance genes.

Stress has been identified as part of the factors causing an outbreak of infections in the aquaculture industry. The most studied neuroendocrine hormonal family from a microbial endocrinology perspective is the catecholamine comprising of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. It is of importance that catecholamine affects the growth and virulence of bacteria. The influence of stress on bacterial infections is attributed to the ability of catecholamines to suppress the immune system as the mode of action for increased bacterial growth. Catecholamines have increased the growth of bacteria, virulence-associated factors, adhesions, and biofilm formation and consequently influence the outcome of infections by these bacteria in many hosts. The siderophores and the ferric iron transport system plays a vital role in the mechanism by which catecholamines stimulates growth and exposure of genes to stress hormones enhances the expression of genes involved in bacterial virulence. In recent years, it has been discovered that intestinal microflora takes part in bidirectional communication between the gut and brain.

Presence of the genus Candida is positively associated with dietary carbohydrates, but are negatively correlated with dietary amino acids, proteins, and fatty acids. However, the relationship between diet and the fungal community (and functions), as well as the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Dysbiosis of intestinal fungi can cause invasive infections and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, it is not clear whether dysbiosis of the mycobiome is a cause, or a result of IBD. Compared to non-inflamed intestinal mucosa, the abundance and diversity of fungi is significantly increased in the inflamed mucosa. The commonly observed commensal fungal species Candida albicans might contribute to occurrence and development of IBD. Limited studies show that Candida albicans might interact with immune cells of the host intestines through the pathways associated with Dectin-1, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and TLR4.

To evaluate the efficacy of the method across spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned from individual villages within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions of Central America. Information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to evaluate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of T. dimidiata, gut microbial diversity, and the blood meal history.

Moreover, recent breakthroughs in germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice have demonstrated the significant impact of the microbiome in modulating behavioral responses in mice and have established a more specific microbiome-gut-behavior axis. One of the mechanisms by which this axis affects social behavior is by regulating myelination at the prefrontal cortex, an important site for complex cognitive behavior planning and decision-making. The prefrontal cortex exhibits late myelination of its axonal projections that could extend into the third decade of life in humans, which make it susceptible to external influences, such as microbial metabolites. Changes in the gut microbiome were shown to alter the composition of the microbial metabolome affecting highly permeable bioactive compounds, such as p-cresol, which could impair oligodendrocyte differentiation. Dysregulated myelination in the prefrontal cortex is then able to affect behavioral responses in mice, shifting them towards social isolation.

Gerrard a long time ago; however, the idea that helminth infections, which induce a strong Th2 could reduce allergy symptoms seems counterintuitive; but the fact is that they have a dual effect: they increase the Th2 responses but also exert immunosuppression and both effects influence the symptoms of allergy. Basic experimentation has provided valuable information about the mechanisms of allergic inflammation and more recently, about its control by helminth induced immunomodulation, discovering helminth molecules with anti-inflammatory properties that are meant to replace the live helminth therapeutic approaches. The immunosuppressive power of helminths makes them excellent candidates to be considered in the hygiene hypotheses. Future comprehensive studies evaluating simultaneously the role of microbial infections, helminth infections, microbiota, pollution and biodiversity will help to elucidate the causes of the increasing trends of allergic disorders.

Microbiota, beside the expected role in maintaining gastrointestinal homeostasis also exerts metabolic functions in nutrients digestion and absorption, detoxification and vitamins' synthesis. Intestinal microbiota is also key in the correct development of the lymphoid system, 70% of which resides at the intestinal level. Available studies, both in murine models and humans, have shown an altered ratio between the different phyla, which characterize a\" normal\" gut microbiota, in a number of different disorders including obesity, to which a significant part of the studies on intestinal microbiota has been addressed so far. These variations in gut microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, has been also described in patients bearing intestinal autoimmune diseases as well as type 1 diabetes mellitus, systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Being Hashimoto's thyroiditis the most frequent autoimmune disorder worldwide, the analysis of the reciprocal influence with intestinal microbiota gained interest. The whole thyroid peripheral homeostasis may be sensitive to microbiota changes but there is also evidence that the genesis and progression of autoimmune thyroid disorders may be significantly affected from a changing intestinal microbial composition or even from overt dysbiosis. In this brief review, we focused on the main features which characterize the reciprocal influence between microbiota and thyroid autoimmunity described in the most recent literature.", "Year": 2019, "Journal": "Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders"}, {"PMID": 30338752, "Abstract": "Bacteria belonging to the genus <i>Streptococcus</i> are the first inhabitants of the oral cavity, which can be acquired right after birth and thus play an important role in the assembly of the oral microbiota. In this article, we discuss the different oral environments inhabited by streptococci and the species that occupy each niche. Special attention is given to the taxonomy of <i>Streptococcus</i>, because this genus is now divided into eight distinct groups, and oral species are found in six of them. Oral streptococci produce an arsenal of adhesive molecules that allow them to efficiently colonize different tissues in the mouth. Also, they have a remarkable ability to metabolize carbohydrates via fermentation, thereby generating acids as byproducts. Excessive acidification of the oral environment by aciduric species such as <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> is directly associated with the development of dental caries. However, less acid-tolerant species such as <i>Streptococcus salivarius</i> and <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i> produce large amounts of alkali, displaying an important role in the acid-base physiology of the oral cavity. Another important characteristic of certain oral streptococci is their ability to generate hydrogen peroxide that can inhibit the growth of <i>S. mutans</i>. Thus, oral streptococci can also be beneficial to the host by producing molecules that are inhibitory to pathogenic species. Lastly, commensal and pathogenic streptococci residing in the oral cavity can eventually gain access to the bloodstream and cause systemic infections such as infective endocarditis.", "Year": 2019, "Journal": "Microbiology spectrum"}, {"PMID": 29767712, "Abstract": "Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been proposed to act as point sources of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment.

Our primary outcome was to determine the proportion of the variability in Internet searches for each unpleasant odor (about the mean) that is explained by a seasonal model. We determined that the seasonal (sinusoidal) model provided a significantly better fit than the null model (best straight line fit) for all searches relating to human body odors (P <.0001 for each).

However, the extent of V. cholerae genetic diversity within an epidemic or even within an individual patient is poorly understood. Here, we characterized V. cholerae genomic diversity at a micro-epidemiological level within and between individual patients from Bangladesh and Haiti. To capture within-patient diversity, we isolated multiple (8 to 20) V. cholerae colonies from each of eight patients, sequenced their genomes and identified point mutations and gene gain/loss events. We found limited but detectable diversity at the level of point mutations within hosts (zero to three single nucleotide variants within each patient), and comparatively higher gene content variation within hosts (at least one gain/loss event per patient, and up to 103 events in one patient). Much of the gene content variation appeared to be due to gain and loss of phage and plasmids within the V. cholerae population, with occasional exchanges between V. cholerae and other members of the gut microbiota. We also show that certain intra-host variants have phenotypic consequences. For example, the acquisition of a Bacteroides plasmid and non-synonymous mutations in a sensor histidine kinase gene both reduced biofilm formation, an important trait for environmental survival.

The resulting information is integrated and translated to different physiological processes, including the regulation of appetite and satiation. Direct chemosensing of fatty acids takes place via interaction with free fatty acid (FFA) and other receptors. These are present in the oronasal cavity and along the entire gastrointestinal tract, in various other tissues, and, for some receptors also in brain. Results from early studies have suggested differences between fatty acids in their ability to induce the release of satiety hormones or their short-term effects on food-intake. However, more recent findings indicate that this has limited impact on long-term energy intake. Similarly, pharmacological strategies for appetite control via modulation of peripheral fatty acid binding receptors have not met their expectations. Regarding the psychobiology of eating behaviour, there has been a shift towards emphasising the importance of food reward and the cephalic phase response. Lipid-rich foods are highly energy dense. During evolution this has stimulated the development of reward mechanisms, in which fatty acids, in conjunction with carbohydrates, are major triggers. Fatty acids are also precursors of endocannabinoids and their structural congeners.

Here, we analyzed the transition from health to gingivitis through both 16S v4-v5 rRNA amplicon and metatranscriptome sequencing of subgingival plaque samples from individuals undergoing an experimental gingivitis treatment. Beta-diversity analysis of 16S rRNA reveals that samples cluster based on disease severity and patient but not by oral hygiene status. Significant shifts in the abundance of several genera occurred during disease transition, suggesting a dysbiosis due to development of gingivitis. Comparing taxonomic abundance with transcriptomic activity revealed concordance of bacterial diversity composition between the two quantification assays in samples originating from both healthy and diseased teeth. Metatranscriptome sequencing analysis indicates that during the early stages of transition to gingivitis, a number of virulence-related transcripts were significantly differentially expressed in individual and across pooled patient samples. Upregulated genes include those involved in proteolytic and nucleolytic processes, while expression levels of those involved in surface structure assembly and other general virulence functions leading to colonization or adaptation within the host are more dynamic. These findings help characterize the transition from health to periodontal disease and identify genes associated with early disease.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Although more than 50% of adults have some form of periodontal disease, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of its underlying cause. We initiated this study in order to better characterize the progression from oral health to disease. We first analyzed changes in the abundances of specific microorganisms in dental plaque collected from teeth during health and gingivitis, the mildest form of periodontal disease. We found that the clinical score of disease and patient from whom the sample originated but not tooth brushing are significantly correlated with microbial community composition. While a number of virulence-related gene transcripts are differentially expressed in gingivitis samples relative to health, not all are increased, suggesting that the overall activity of the microbiota is dynamic during disease transition. Better understanding of which microbes are present and their function during early periodontal disease can potentially lead to more targeted prophylactic approaches to prevent disease progression.", "Year": 2019, "Journal": "mBio"}, {"PMID": 30306557, "Abstract": "The growing knowledge of the key role of microbiota in the maturation of neonatal immune system suggests that manipulation of microbiota could be exploited in hampering allergy development.

Development of new antibiotics lags behind; therefore, novel approaches to the problem of antibiotic resistance are sorely needed and this commentary highlights one relatively unexplored target for drug development: conjugation. Conjugation is a common mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria that is instrumental in the spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Most resistance genes are found on mobile genetic elements and primarily spread by conjugation. Furthermore, conjugative elements can act as a reservoir to maintain antibiotic resistance in the bacterial population even in the absence of antibiotic selection. Thus, conjugation can spread antibiotic resistance quickly between bacteria of the microbiome and pathogens when selective pressure (antibiotics) is introduced. Potential drug targets include the plasmid-encoded conjugation system and the host-encoded proteins important for conjugation.

Recent discoveries have underscored that changes in the microbiota modulate the host immune system by modulating Trp metabolism. Moreover, Trp, endogenous Trp metabolites (kynurenines, serotonin, and melatonin), and bacterial Trp metabolites (indole, indolic acid, skatole, and tryptamine) have profound effects on gut microbial composition, microbial metabolism, the host's immune system, the host-microbiome interface, and host immune system-intestinal microbiota interactions. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediates the regulation of intestinal immunity by Trp metabolites (as ligands of AhR), which is beneficial for immune homeostasis. Among Trp metabolites, AhR ligands consist of endogenous metabolites, including kynurenine, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, and cinnabarinic acid, and bacterial metabolites, including indole, indole propionic acid, indole acetic acid, skatole, and tryptamine.

A common virulence strategy is to express a type III secretion system (T3SS), which is a molecular syringe deployed by many Gram-negative pathogens to hijack host cell function. Enterohemorrhagic <i>Escherichia</i><i>coli</i> (EHEC) requires its T3SS to colonize the intestinal tract and cause disease. Here we report that a prominent member of the intestinal microbiota, <i>Bacteroides thetaiotamicron</i> (<i>Bt</i>), secretes proteases that cleave the translocon of the T3SS of EHEC to enhance effector translocation into host cells. This is in contrast from an endogenous protease from EHEC itself (namely, EspP) that cleaves the translocon protein EspB in a different site to limit effector translocation. The EspB protein forms the T3SS pore in mammalian cells, and pore proteins are conserved in the T3SSs from several pathogens. This is the first demonstration of a commensal species directly processing a pathogen's T3SS, posing a new paradigm for how the microbiota can influence the severity of disease caused by bacterial pathogens. Because T3SSs are employed by many pathogens, this phenomenon has broad implications to commensal-pathogen relationships.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The gut microbiota is usually regarded as providing colonization resistance against enteric pathogens. However, some pathogens evolved to thrive with the aid of certain members of the microbiota. Several Gram-negative bacteria employ type three secretion systems (T3SSs), which are molecular syringes that deliver effector proteins to host cells, hijacking host cell function. Here we show that the T3SS of enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> (EHEC) is cleaved by self and microbiota-derived proteases. Self-cleavage limits effector translocation, while cleavage by the microbiota member <i>Bacteroides thetaiotamicron</i> (<i>Bt</i>) exacerbates effector translocation and lesion formation on epithelial cells.", "Year": 2019, "Journal": "mBio"}, {"PMID": 30001516, "Abstract": "The acquisition and development of the infant microbiome are key to establishing a healthy host-microbiome symbiosis.

This evidence points to the existence of complex pathogenic pathways linking the occurrence of gallstones to altered systemic homeostasis involving multiple organs and dynamics.

Discrete changes in the nervous system, and to a lesser extent the enteroendocrine system, occur following helminth infection but the importance of these adaptations in expelling the worm is poorly understood.

In spite of decades of productivity, the use of bacteria in the search for new antibiotics was largely abandoned due to high rediscovery rates<sup>2,3</sup>. As only a fraction of bacterial diversity is regularly cultivated in the laboratory and just a fraction of the chemistries encoded by cultured bacteria are detected in fermentation experiments, most bacterial NPs remain hidden in the global microbiome. In an effort to access these hidden NPs, we have developed a culture-independent NP discovery platform that involves sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters captured on DNA extracted from environmental samples. Here, we describe the application of this platform to the discovery of the malacidins, a distinctive class of antibiotics that are commonly encoded in soil microbiomes but have never been reported in culture-based NP discovery efforts.

However, it is unclear whether MAIT cells discriminate between many species of the human microbiota. To address this, we developed an in vitro functional assay through human T cells engineered for MAIT-TCRs (eMAIT-TCRs) stimulated by MR1-expressing antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We then screened 47 microbiota-associated bacterial species from different phyla for their eMAIT-TCR stimulatory capacities. Only bacterial species that encoded the riboflavin pathway were stimulatory for MAIT-TCRs. Most species that were high stimulators belonged to Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla, whereas low/non-stimulator species were primarily Actinobacteria or Firmicutes. Activation of MAIT cells by high- vs low-stimulating bacteria also correlated with the level of riboflavin they secreted or after bacterial infection of macrophages. Remarkably, we found that human T-cell subsets can also present riboflavin metabolites to MAIT cells in a MR1-restricted fashion. This T-T cell-mediated signaling also induced IFN\u03b3, TNF and granzyme B from MAIT cells, albeit at lower level than professional APC.

Several processing methods have been developed to modify the functional, textural and breadmaking properties of wheat bran, which can affect the gut microbiota. We therefore studied the effect of enzyme treatment, particle size reduction and wheat kernel pearling on the faecal microbiota of ten healthy individuals. The most commonly studied health marker, associated to the gut microbiota activity is Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) production. This study shows that modifying wheat bran physicochemical properties allows control over the extent and the rate of SCFA production by the faecal microbiota. Wheat bran pericarp fractions, depleted in starch and enriched in cellulose and highly branched arabinoxylans, were poorly fermentable compared to unmodified wheat bran, thus resulting in a reduced SCFA production with up to 20 mM. The nature of the SCFA, however, largely depends on the donor and can be linked to the individual's gut microbiota composition. The latter changed in an individually dependent manner in response to wheat bran modification. Some product dependent significant differences could still be identified across the ten donors. This product effect is more pronounced in the microbial community attached to the wheat bran residue as compared to the luminal microbial community.

The LAB microbiota of the mature CSC-cheeses was dominated by nonstarter strains of Lactobacillus paracasei and Lb. plantarum whereas indigenous Enterococcus faecium and E. durans strains of high phenotypic and genotypic diversity predominated in the respective NSC-cheeses. Populations of enterococci in CSC-cheeses were subdominant by 10 to 100-fold compared with those in NSC-cheeses; E. faecium was the most frequently isolated Enterococcus species from the mature CSC-cheeses.

Genes and gene pathways that encode enzymes catalyzing biotransformation of host bile acids are important to identify in gut metagenomic sequences due to the importance of bile acids in gut microbiome structure and host physiology. Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDHs) are pyridine nucleotide-dependent enzymes with stereospecificity and regiospecificity for bile acid and steroid hydroxyl groups. HSDHs have been identified in several protein families, including medium-chain and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase families as well as the aldo-keto reductase family. These protein families are large and contain diverse functionalities, making prediction of HSDH-encoding genes difficult and necessitating biochemical characterization. We located a gene cluster in <i>Eggerthella</i> sp.

Whenever movement is important for survival or growth, these correlated rearrangements could couple the evolutionary fate of different lineages. However, little is known about the interplay between mechanical forces and evolution in dense cellular populations. Here, by tracking slower-growing clones at the expanding edge of yeast colonies, we show that the collective motion of cells prevents costly mutations from being weeded out rapidly. Joint pushing by neighbouring cells generates correlated movements that suppress the differential displacements required for selection to act. This mechanical screening of fitness differences allows slower-growing mutants to leave more descendants than expected under non-mechanical models, thereby increasing their chance for evolutionary rescue.

In these women, the vaginal microbiome shifted during pregnancy toward Lactobacillus-dominated profiles at the expense of taxa often associated with vaginal dysbiosis. The shifts occurred early in pregnancy, followed predictable patterns, were associated with simplification of the metabolic capacity of the microbiome and were significant only in women of African or Hispanic ancestry.

These diseases include neurodegenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), vascular (e.g. atherosclerosis, pre-eclampsia, type 2 diabetes) and autoimmune (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis) diseases that may appear to have little in common. In fact they all share significant features, in particular chronic inflammation and its attendant inflammatory cytokines. Such effects do not happen without underlying and initially 'external' causes, and it is of interest to seek these causes. Taking a systems approach, we argue that these causes include (i) stress-induced iron dysregulation, and (ii) its ability to awaken dormant, non-replicating microbes with which the host has become infected. Other external causes may be dietary. Such microbes are capable of shedding small, but functionally significant amounts of highly inflammagenic molecules such as lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid. Sequelae include significant coagulopathies, not least the recently discovered amyloidogenic clotting of blood, leading to cell death and the release of further inflammagens.

Due to their potential applications in diverse sectors, such as food, biotechnology, cosmetics, and medicine, EPSs synthesized by bifidobacteria have recently attracted more attention. EPS production not only has benefits in food and health but also has effects on probiotics in the microbial ecosystem. In this study, we investigated the interaction between bifidobacteria EPSs and human gut microbiota in vitro using thin-layer chromatography, 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing, and gas chromatography. The results showed that human gut microbiota has the capacity to degrade EPSs, although the degradation rate was approximately 50% after fermenting for 48\u00a0h. On the other hand, EPSs regulate the human gut microbiota. Fermented samples in the VI_Bif group clustered together according to the bacterial community compared to the VI_Starch group, in which starch was added as a carbon source. The bifidobacteria EPS promoted the growth of phylum Deinococcus_Thermus, class Deinococci, order Deinococcales, and genus Coprococcus. EPSs also increased the production of propionic acid compared to the starch group. The detection results of Dionex ICS 5000 high-purity capillary ion chromatography system showed that EPSs had absorption peaks of fucose, rhamnose, galactose/acetyl glucosamine, glucose, and ribose, and the molecular proportion of these monosaccharides was approximately 2: 2: 440: 3: 53.

The aim of this narrative review was to analyse the current knowledge about dysbiosis and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in ASD and assess the current evidence for the role of probiotics and other non-pharmacological approaches in the treatment of children with ASD. Analysis of the literature showed that gut dysbiosis in ASD has been widely demonstrated; however, there is no single distinctive profile of the composition of the microbiota in people with ASD.

This is due to a lack of new antimicrobials coming to the market and irresponsible use of traditional antibiotics. Bactofencin A, a novel antimicrobial peptide which shows potential as an antibiotic, is susceptible to enzyme degradation. To improve its solution stability and inherent activity, bactofencin A was loaded onto a traditional silica mesoporous matrix, SBA-15, and a periodic mesoporous organosilane, MSE. The loading of bactofencin A was considerably higher onto SBA-15 than MSE due to the hydrophilic nature of SBA-15. While there was no detectable peptide released from SBA-15 into phosphate buffered saline and only 20% of the peptide loaded onto MSE was released, the loaded matrices showed enhanced activity compared to the free peptide during in vitro antimicrobial assays. In addition, the mesoporous matrices were found to protect bactofencin A against enzymatic degradation where results showed that the SBA-15 and MSE with loaded bactofencin A exposed to trypsin inhibited the growth of S. aureus while a large decrease in activity was observed for free bactofencin upon exposure to trypsin. Thus, the activity and stability of bactofencin A can be enhanced using mesoporous matrices and these matrices may enable its potential development as a novel antibiotic.
