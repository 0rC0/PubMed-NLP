The inner mucus layer is free of commensal microbiota, which contributes to the maintenance of gut homeostasis. In the small intestine, molecules critical for prevention of bacterial invasion into epithelia such as Paneth-cell-derived anti-microbial peptides and regenerating islet-derived 3 (RegIII) family proteins have been identified. Although there are mucus layers providing physical barriers against the large number of microbiota present in the large intestine, the mechanisms that separate bacteria and colonic epithelia are not fully elucidated. Here we show that Ly6/PLAUR domain containing 8 (Lypd8) protein prevents flagellated microbiota invading the colonic epithelia in mice. Lypd8, selectively expressed in epithelial cells at the uppermost layer of the large intestinal gland, was secreted into the lumen and bound flagellated bacteria including Proteus mirabilis. In the absence of Lypd8, bacteria were present in the inner mucus layer and many flagellated bacteria invaded epithelia. Lypd8(-/-) mice were highly sensitive to intestinal inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Antibiotic elimination of Gram-negative flagellated bacteria restored the bacterial-free state of the inner mucus layer and ameliorated DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in Lypd8(-/-) mice. Lypd8 bound to flagella and suppressed motility of flagellated bacteria. Thus, Lypd8 mediates segregation of intestinal bacteria and epithelial cells in the colon to preserve intestinal homeostasis.

Prof MacLean of Guy's Hospital wrote in the Postgraduate Medical Journal in 1926 about the numerous challenges that faced patients and their healthcare professionals in delivering safe and effective diabetes care at that time. The discovery of insulin in 1922 heralded a new age in enabling long-term glycaemic control, which reduced morbidity and mortality. Thirty years later, the first oral agents for diabetes, the biguanides and sulfonylureas, appeared and freed type 2 patients from having to inject insulin following diagnosis. Improvements in insulin formulations over the decades, including rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogues that more closely mimic physiological insulin secretion, have increased the flexibility and efficacy of type 1 diabetes management. The last two decades have seen major advances in technology, which has manifested in more accurate glucose monitoring systems and insulin delivery devices ('insulin pump'). Increased understanding of the pathophysiological deficits underlying type 2 diabetes has led to the development of targeted therapeutic approaches such as on the small intestine (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogues and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitors) and kidneys (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors). A patient-centred approach delivered by a multidisciplinary team is now advocated. Glycaemic targets are set according to individual circumstances, taking into account factors such as weight, hypoglycaemia risk and patient preference. Stepwise treatment guidelines devised by international diabetes organisations standardise and rationalise management. Structured education programmes and psychological support are now well-established as essential for improving patient motivation and self-empowerment. Large multicentre randomised trials have confirmed the effectiveness of intensive glycaemic control on microvascular outcomes, but macrovascular outcomes and cardiovascular safety remain controversial with several glucose-lowering agents. Future directions in diabetes care include strategies such as the 'bionic pancreas', stem cell therapy and targeting the intestinal microbiome.

Since 2005, sequencing of the chaperonin-60 universal target (cpn60 UT) has distinguished four subgroups in isolate collections, clone libraries and deep sequencing datasets. To clarify potential clinical and diagnostic significance of cpn60 subgroups, we undertook phenotypic and molecular characterization of 112 G. vaginalis isolates from three continents. A total of 36 subgroup A, 33 B, 35 C and 8 D isolates were identified through phylogenetic analysis of cpn60 sequences as corresponding to four \"clades\" identified in a recently published study, based on sequencing 473 genes across 17 isolates. cpn60 subgroups were compared with other previously described molecular methods for classification of Gardnerella subgroups, including amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and real-time PCR assays designed to quantify subgroups in vaginal samples. Although two ARDRA patterns were observed in isolates, each was observed in three cpn60 subgroups (A/B/D and B/C/D). Real-time PCR assays corroborated cpn60 subgroups overall, but 13 isolates from subgroups A, B and D were negative in all assays.

Such localised cell death processes might also contribute strongly to the specific diseases of interest.

For example, the standard urine culture does not detect slow-growing bacteria that die in the presence of oxygen. Two new, complementary tools, however, can detect these and other organisms, which permits a more complete characterization of bacterial communities within the female bladder. Obstetrician-gynecologists should become familiar with these new approaches (expanded quantitative urine culture and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing) that can detect previously unrecognized organisms. These advances are making it possible to answer previously intractable scientific and clinical questions. Traditional nomenclature used to describe the bacterial status in the bladder is quite dated and unsuited for the emerging information about the bacterial milieu of the female urinary tract. In the context of the sterile bladder paradigm, clinicians have learned about \"uropathogens,\" \"asymptomatic bacteriuria,\" and \"urinary tract infection.\" Given that the lower urinary tract is not sterile, these terms should be reevaluated. Clinicians can already benefit from the emerging knowledge regarding urinary organisms that have previously gone undetected or unappreciated. For example, in some subpopulations of women with urinary symptoms, existing data suggest that the urinary bacterial community may be associated with women's health conditions of interest. This Clinical Opinion highlights the inadequacies of the current tools for urinary bacterial assessment, describes the new assessment tools, explains the current interpretation of the resulting data, and proposes potential clinical uses and relevance. A new world is opening to our view that will give us the opportunity to better understand urinary bacteria and the bladder in which they live.

The shedding of epithelial cell layers is usually effective for controlling biofilm development on soft tissues. Innate immune mechanisms are not so effective against biofilms on tooth surfaces, and oral hygiene measures such as brushing and flossing are required for the periodic removal of dental plaque. Even with good oral hygiene, microbial communities accumulate on teeth in areas that are protected from mechanical abrasion forces. Changes in the composition of these biofilms are associated with oral diseases such as dental caries or periodontitis. Newly formed biofilms and more mature dental plaque each have a level of spatial organization in the horizontal and vertical planes. Communities are shaped by many varied interactions between different species and genera within the biofilm, which include physical cell-cell associations known as coaggregation, interspecies signaling, secretion and turnover of antimicrobial compounds and the sharing of an extracellular matrix. Central to these interactions is the selection for metabolic synergies and it is becoming clear that the ability of communities to extract the maximum energy from the available metabolites is a potent driver for biofilm structure and stratification.

Moreover, changes in microbiota composition in the old age have been related to immunosenescence and inflammatory processes that are pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the pathways of frailty. Frailty is an age-related condition of increased vulnerability to stresses due to the impairment in multiple inter-related physiologic systems that are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as falls, delirium, institutionalization, hospitalization and death. Preliminary data suggest that changes in microbiota composition may contribute to the variations in the biological, clinical, functional and psycho-social domains that occur in the frail older subjects. Multidimensional evaluation tools based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) have demonstrated to be useful in identifying and measuring the severity of frailty in older subjects. Thus, a CGA approach should be used more widely in clinical practice to evaluate the multidimensional effects potentially related to GI microbiota composition of the older subjects.

Farm piglets were nursed by their mothers for 1 day, before removal to highly controlled, individual isolators where they received formula milk until weaning at 21 days. The experiment was repeated, to create two batches, which differed only in minor environmental fluctuations during the first day. At day 1 after birth, metabolic profiling of serum by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated significant, systemic, inter-batch variation which persisted until weaning.

Batch effects were linked to significant differences in the composition of colonic microbiota at 35 days, determined by 16 S pyrosequencing.

Early on, fresh feces from patient-identified donors was used and administered by several routes. FMT cure rates for RCDI remain approximately 82% and 91% when fresh stool is given by the upper GI and lower GI routes, respectively, but now we are moving in the direction of using carefully vetted volunteers whose stool is processed into a variety of formulations including lyophilized material and even capsules. It is very likely that an array of products derived from feces or based on specific microbiotic profiles and commercially prepared in a controlled environment will be available to restore eubiosis to a dysbiotic intestinal microbial community, and thereby correct a variety of GI and non-GI disorders. We are witnessing a paradigm shift in therapeutics. Previously, bacteria were thought of only as potential pathogens, whereas now we appreciate that a diverse community of bacteria is crucial to the health of the host. We are now learning that to restore such diversity once it has been interrupted can result in miraculous cure. The future of microbiotic therapy is bright.

Upstream of the previously characterized gene cluster involved in lacto-N-biose and galacto-N-biose metabolism from Lactobacillus casei BL23, there are two genes, bnaG and manA, encoding a \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase precursor and a mannose-6-phosphate isomerase, respectively. In this work, we show that L. casei is able to grow in the presence of lacto-N-triose as a carbon source. Inactivation of bnaG abolished the growth of L. casei on this oligosaccharide, demonstrating that BnaG is involved in its metabolism. Interestingly, whole cells of a bnaG mutant were totally devoid of \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, suggesting that BnaG is an extracellular wall-attached enzyme.

The first two edges of the antibiotic sword were identified immediately after their discovery and deployment in that they not only benefit an individual in treating their infection but also benefit the community in preventing the spread of that infectious agent. The third edge was already recognized by Alexander Fleming in 1945 in his Nobel acceptance speech, which warned about the cost to the community of antibiotic resistance that would inevitably evolve and be selected for during clinical practice. We have seen this cost mount up, as resistance curtails or precludes the activities of some of our most effective drugs for clinically important infections.

In addition, we and others have shown that the methanogenic Archaea may also contribute to altered metabolism and weight gain in the host. However, much remains to be learned about the roles of different gut microbial populations in weight gain and obesity and the underlying mechanisms before we can begin to approach targeted treatments.

An important part of this barrier comes from antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are small peptides expressed abundantly in the skin. AMPs are produced in the deeper layers of the epidermis and transported to the stratum corneum, where they play a vital role in the first line of defense against potential pathogens. Numerous AMPs exist, and they have a broad antibiotic-like activity against bacteria, fungi and viruses. They also act as multifunctional effector molecules, linking innate and adaptive immune responses. AMPs play an essential part in maintaining an optimal and functional skin barrier - not only by direct killing of pathogens, but also by balancing immune responses and interfering in wound healing, cell differentiation, reepithelialization and their synergistic interplay with the skin microflora.

While the pathology of E. coli O157:H7 infection has been well studied, the effect of it's multiple resulting cytotoxic mechanisms on host metabolic activity has not been well characterized. To develop a more thorough understanding of these effects, several bioluminescence assays were evaluated for their ability to track both toxicity and host metabolic activity levels in real-time. The use of continuously autobioluminescent human cells was determined to be the most favorable method for tracking these metrics, as its self-sufficient autobioluminescent phenotype was unaffected by the presence of the infecting bacteria and its signal could be measured without cellular destruction. Using this approach, it was determined that infection with as few as 10 CFU of E. coli O157:H7 could elicit cytotoxic effects. Regardless of the initial infective dose, an impact on metabolic expression was not observed until bacterial populations reached levels between 5 \u00d7 10(5) and 1 \u00d7 10(6) (R(2) = 0.933), indicating that a critical bacterial infection level must be reached prior to the onset of cytotoxic effects. Supporting this hypothesis, it was found that cells displaying infection-mediated metabolic activity reductions could recover to wild type metabolic activity levels if the infecting bacteria were removed prior to cell death.

The mechanism providing protection appears to be related to the unique ability of O. formigenes to rely on oxalate as a major source of carbon and energy for growth. However, much is not known about the factors that influence colonization and host-bacterium interactions. We have colonized mice with O. formigenes OxCC13 and systematically investigated the impacts of diets with different levels of calcium and oxalate on O. formigenes intestinal densities and urinary and intestinal oxalate levels. Measurement of intestinal oxalate levels in mice colonized or not colonized with O. formigenes demonstrated the highly efficient degradation of soluble oxalate by O. formigenes relative to other microbiota. The ratio of calcium to oxalate in diets was important in determining colonization densities and conditions where urinary oxalate and fecal oxalate excretion were modified, and the results were consistent with those from studies we have performed with colonized and noncolonized humans. The use of low-oxalate purified diets showed that 80% of animals retained O. formigenes colonization after a 1-week dietary oxalate deprivation. Animals not colonized with O. formigenes excreted two times more oxalate in feces than they had ingested. This nondietary source of oxalate may play an important role in the survival of O. formigenes during periods of dietary oxalate deprivation.

A dysfunction of this axis has been associated with the pathogenesis of some diseases both within and outside the GIT, that have shown an increase in incidence over the last decades. Studies comparing germ-free animals and animals exposed to pathogenic bacterial infections, probiotics or antibiotics suggest the participation of the microbiota in this communication and a role in host defense, regulation of immunity and autoimmune disease appearance. The GIT could represent a vulnerable area through which pathogens influence all aspects of physiology and even induce CNS neuro-inflammation. All those concepts may suggest the modulation of the gut microbiota as an achievable strategy for innovative therapies in complex disorders. Moving from this background, the present review discusses the relationship between intestinal microbiota and CNS and the effects in health and disease. We particularly look at how the commensal gut microbiota influences systemic immune response in some neurological disorders, highlighting its impact on pain and cognition in multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e8 Syndrome, neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders and Alzheimer's disease.

These cells not only play a key role in the defense against pathogens, but also exert potent immunoregulatory functions. The regulatory role of iNKT cells in the prevention of type 1 diabetes has been demonstrated in murine models and analyzed in diabetic patients. The decreased frequency of iNKT cells in non-obese diabetic mice initially suggested the regulatory role of this cell subset. Increasing the frequency or the activation of iNKT cells with agonists protects non-obese diabetic mice from the development of diabetes. Several mechanisms mediate iNKT regulatory functions. They can rapidly produce immunoregulatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10. They induce tolerogenic dendritic cells, thereby inducing the anergy of autoreactive anti-islet T cells and increasing the frequency of T regulatory cells (Treg cells). Synthetic agonists are able to activate iNKT cells and represent potential therapeutic treatment in order to prevent type 1 diabetes.

The last theory holds that any cell stress and tissue injury including allograft injury, via induction of damage-associated molecular patterns, induces immunity including alloimmunity leading to allograft rejection. On the other hand, the concept precludes that \"non-self \" per se induces immunity as proposed by the two former theories. Today, the danger/injury model has been largely accepted by immunologists, as documented by a steadily increasing number of publications. In particular, overwhelming evidence in support of the correctness of the model has come from recent studies on the gut microbiota representing a huge assemblage of \"non-self. \" Here, harmless noninjurious commensal microbes are protected by innate immunity-based immune tolerance whereas intestinal injury-causing pathogenic microbes are immunology attacked. The ability of the immune system to discriminate between harmless beneficial \"non-self \" to induce tolerance and harmful life-threatening \"non-self \" to induce immunity has apparently emerged during evolution: Protection of innate immunity-controlled beneficial \"non-self \" (eg, as reflected by microbiotas but also by the fetus of placental mammals) as well as immune defense responses to injuring/injured \"non-self \" (eg, as reflected by plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stress and allograft rejection in mammals) evolved under pressure across the tree of life, that is, in plants, lower and higher invertebrates as well as lower and higher vertebrates.

An understanding of the interactions and mechanisms through which commensal and food-derived microbes shape host immunity and metabolism may yield new insights into the pathogenesis of many immune-mediated diseases. Consequently, by manipulating the contribution of food microbiota to the functionality of the gut ecosystem, there is great hope for development of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. This paper presents some insights and comments on the possible impact of exogenous fermented food microbes on the gut homeostasis. We shed light on the similar features shared by both fermented food microbes and probiotics. In particular, the key role of microbial strains as part of food ecosystems for health and diseases is discussed through the prism of fermented dairy products and gut inflammation.

Correlating the large number of 'omics' features with a certain phenotype is particularly challenging due to small sample size (n) and high dimensionality (p). To address this small n, large p problem, various forms of sparse regression models have been proposed by exploiting the sparsity assumption. Among these, network-constrained sparse regression model is of particular interest due to its ability to utilize the prior graph/network structure in the omics data. Despite its potential usefulness for omics data analysis, no efficient R implementation is publicly available. Here we present an R software package 'glmgraph' that implements the graph-constrained regularization for both sparse linear regression and sparse logistic regression. We implement both the L1 penalty and minimax concave penalty for variable selection and Laplacian penalty for coefficient smoothing.

Gut microbiota trajectories and short-chain fatty acid production profiles were followed starting from before HSCT and through the 3-4 months after transplant in children developing and not developing aGvHD.

Our data indicate that structure and temporal dynamics of the gut microbial ecosystem can be a relevant factor for the success of HSCT and opens the perspective to the manipulation of the pre-HSCT gut microbiota configuration to favor mutualistic persisters with immunomodulatory properties in the gut.

Central mechanisms are: the psychosocial history and environment, dysfunctional brain processing of peripheral signals attributed to the intestine including the enteric nervous system, the microbiome and the innate and adaptive immune system. As a result there is visceral hypersensitivity and disturbed intestinal secretory and motor activity. Some mechanisms of visceral pain hypersensitivity may overlap with other pain syndromes including fibromyalgia (FMS).

Multiple host innate mechanisms contribute to intestinal homeostasis, including epithelial production of protective mucin layers maintaining spatial segregation in the intestine as well as epithelial cell secretion of a broad range of antimicrobial peptides. Additionally, epithelial cells employ autophagy to contain and eliminate invading bacteria; interestingly, genetic variants in specific autophagy genes are linked to susceptibility to Crohn's disease. Innate lymphoid cells, which rapidly respond to cytokine and microbial signals, have emerged as important regulators of the intestinal immune response to the microbiota. With regard to adaptive immunity, specific microbial species stimulate induction of regulatory T cells while others induce effector T cells within the gut. Such stimulation is subject to dysregulation during inflammation and disease, contributing to 'dysbiosis' or an abnormal microbiota composition that has been associated with a variety of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, including celiac disease. The microbiota communicates with the immune system and vice versa; thus, an abnormal microbiota composition likely translates into an altered host immune response, though the exact mechanisms of such are not yet clear. Immunoglobulin A plays a critical role in limiting bacterial access to the host and in maintaining mutualism with the microbiota. Perturbation of the mucosal barrier via infection or other means can induce effector T cells reactive to the intestinal microbiota, and these cells can persist as memory cells for extended periods of time and potentially serve as pathogenic effector cells upon re-encounter with antigen.

First of all, the key finding is that ethanol is a prodrug, enabling the idea that AFLD may develop with negligible/absent BAC. Second, extrahepatic acetaldehyde (ACD) alone recapitulates AFLD and is about 330-fold more hepatotoxic than that generated inside the liver. Third, gut microbiota can even produce much larger amounts of EE than those currently considered cirrhotogenic for man. Fourth, an extensive gut-liver axis first-pass metabolism of ethanol prevents the development of significant BAC in NAFLD. Fifth, all genes involved in EE metabolism are upregulated in the livers of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Last, overexpression of the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 4 implicates liver exposure to high concentrations of EE. In conclusion, this work provides mechanistic explanation supporting the assumption that NAFLD may indeed be an EAFLD. If validated by further testing, the hypothesis may help develop novel therapeutic and preventive strategies against this ubiquitous condition.

Two K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from the microbiota, which were both resistant to amoxicillin and ampicillin, were also analyzed.

The K. pneumoniae isolates showed different morphological and ultrastructural changes after subjection to \u03b2-lactams tested at different concentrations, such as cell filamentation, loss of cytoplasmic material, and deformation of dividing septa. Our results demonstrate that K. pneumoniae isolates harboring different genes that encode for \u03b2-lactamases show cell alterations when subjected to different \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, thus suggesting that they possess residual activity in vitro, despite the phenotypic resistance presented in the isolates analyzed.

These were applied to six human stool samples using Illumina HiSeq, MiSeq and Ion PGM shotgun sequencing, as well as amplicon sequencing across two variable 16S rRNA gene regions. Notably, we found that the factor responsible for the greatest variance in microbiota composition was the chosen methodology rather than the natural inter-individual variance, which is commonly one of the most significant drivers in microbiome studies. Amplicon sequencing suffered from this to a large extent, and this issue was particularly apparent when the 16S rRNA V1-V2 region amplicons were sequenced with MiSeq. Somewhat surprisingly, the choice of taxonomic binning software for shotgun sequences proved to be of crucial importance with even greater discriminatory power than sequencing technology and choice of amplicon. Optimal N50 assembly values for the HiSeq was obtained for 10 million reads per sample, whereas the applied MiSeq and PGM sequencing depths proved less sufficient for shotgun sequencing of stool samples.

The dysregulated microbiota in the model induced transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) expression, which in turn induced FGF2 expression mainly in regulatory T\u00a0cells. Act1, an essential adaptor in IL-17 signaling, suppressed FGF2-induced ERK activation through binding to adaptor molecule GRB2 to interfere with its association with guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS1. Act1 preferentially bound to IL-17 receptor complex, releasing its suppressive effect on FGF2 signaling. Thus, microbiota-driven FGF2 and IL-17 cooperate to repair the damaged intestinal epithelium through Act1-mediated direct signaling cross-talk.

It also provides additional search tools and hyperlinks for the rapid selection of food groups and OTUs and for rapid access to external resources (NCBI taxonomy, digital versions of the original articles). Microbial interaction network analysis was carried out using CoNet on datasets extracted from FoodMicrobionet: the complexity of interaction networks was much lower than that found for other bacterial communities (human microbiome, soil and other environments).

Our focus revolves around the interaction of the gut microbiota with liver diseases, especially cirrhosis. The bile acid pool size has recently been shown to be a function of microbial metabolism of bile acid, and regulation of the microbiota by bile acids is important in the development and progression of several liver diseases. Humans produce a large, conjugated hydrophilic bile acid pool, maintained through positive-feedback antagonism of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine and liver. Microbes use bile acids, and via FXR signaling this results in a smaller, unconjugated hydrophobic bile acid pool. This equilibrium is critical to maintain health. The challenge is to examine the manifold functions of gut bile acids as modulators of antibiotic, probiotic, and disease progression in cirrhosis, metabolic syndrome, and alcohol use. Recent studies have shown potential mechanisms explaining how perturbations in the microbiome affect bile acid pool size and composition. With advancing liver disease and cirrhosis, there is dysbiosis in the fecal, ileal, and colonic mucosa, in addition to a decrease in bile acid concentration in the intestine due to the liver problems. This results in a dramatic shift toward the Firmicutes, particularly Clostridium cluster XIVa, and increasing production of deoxycholic acid. Alcohol intake speeds up these processes in the subjects with and without cirrhosis without significant FXR feedback.

Clustering short sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is an initial crucial process in analyzing metagenomic data. Although many methods have been proposed for OTU inferences, a major challenge is the balance between inference accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we present a novel motif-based hierarchical method (namely MtHc) for clustering massive 16S rRNA sequences into OTUs with high clustering accuracy and low memory usage. Suppose all the 16S rRNA sequences can be used to construct a complete weighted network, where sequences are viewed as nodes, each pair of sequences is connected by an imaginary edge, and the distance of a pair of sequences represents the weight of the edge. MtHc consists of three main phrases. First, heuristically search the motif that is defined as n-node sub-graph (in the present study, n = 3, 4, 5), in which the distance between any two nodes is less than a threshold. Second, use the motif as a seed to form candidate clusters by computing the distances of other sequences with the motif. Finally, hierarchically merge the candidate clusters to generate the OTUs by only calculating the distances of motifs between two clusters. Compared with the existing methods on several simulated and real-life metagenomic datasets, we demonstrate that MtHc has higher clustering performance, less memory usage and robustness for setting parameters, and that it is more effective to handle the large-scale metagenomic datasets. The MtHC software can be freely download from for academic users.

Furthermore Hh-infected mice immunised parenterally with the recombinant subunit vaccine, human adenovirus type 5 expressing the immunodominant antigen 85A of Mtb (Ad85A), display a reduced lung immune response and protection against Mtb challenge is also reduced.

Twenty-four healthy people were chosen as controls. Pyrosequencing was performed on the V3 hypervariable region of 16S rDNA in all bacterial samples and used as a culture-independent method to describe the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota. Through pyrosequencing, 271,764 amplicons were detected in samples and analysed using tools in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) and bioinformatics. These analyses revealed significant differences in the microbiota in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) of TB patients compared with healthy controls; in contrast, the microbiota of intra/extra-TB lesions were similar. These results showed that the dominant bacterial genus in the LRT of TB patients was Cupriavidus and not Streptococcus, which resulted in a significant change in the microbiota in TB patients. The abundance of Mycobacteria and Porphyromonas significantly increased inside TB lesions when compared with non-lesion-containing contralateral lungs. From these data, it can be concluded that Cupriavidus plays an important role in TB's secondary infection and that in addition to Mycobacteria, Porphyromonas may also be a co-factor in lesion formation.

We conducted experimental challenge trials to distinguish whether factors extrinsic or intrinsic to cattle underlie the seasonality of STEC O157 colonization. Holstein steers (n = 20) exposed to ambient environmental conditions were challenged with a standardized pool of STEC O157 strains four times at 6-month intervals. The densities and durations of rectoanal junction mucosa (RAJ) colonization with STEC O157 were compared by season (winter versus summer), dose (10(9) CFU versus 10(7) CFU), and route of challenge (oral versus rectal). Following summer challenges, the RAJ STEC O157 colonization density was significantly lower (P = 0.016) and the duration was shorter (P = 0.052) than for winter challenges, a seasonal pattern opposite to that observed naturally. Colonization was unaffected by the challenge route, indicating that passage through the gastrointestinal microbiome did not significantly affect the infectious dose to the RAJ. A 2-log reduction of the challenge doses in the second-year trials was accompanied by similarly reduced RAJ colonization in both seasons (P < 0.001). These results refute the hypothesis that cattle are predisposed to STEC O157 colonization during the summer months, either due to intrinsic factors or indirectly due to gastrointestinal tract microbiome effects.

Diets high in saturated fats and refined sugars and low in fiber are leading candidates for these events and for triggering the increased prevalence of immune-mediated diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our studies have shown that consumption of a 'Western' diet high in saturated (milk-derived) fat (MF) or n-6 polyunsaturated (safflower oil) fat have similar effects on the structure of the colonic microbiome of wild-type and IL- 10(-/-) mice, characterized by increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes. However, the MF diet uniquely promotes the expansion of an immunogenic sulfite-reducing pathobiont, Bilophila wadsworthia, a member of the Deltaproteobacteria and minor component of the gut microbiome. This bacterial bloom results from a MF diet-induced shift in hepatic conjugation of bile acids, from glycocholic to taurocholic (TC) acid, which is important for solubilizing the more hydrophobic MF diet. However, it is also responsible for delivery of taurine-derived sulfur to the distal bowel, promoting the assemblage of bile-tolerant microbes such as B. wadsworthia. The bloom of this species promotes a Th1-mediated immune response and the development of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. A similar bloom of B. wadsworthia is seen when IL-10(-/-) mice are fed a low-fat diet supplemented with TC. B. wadsworthia colonization of monoassociated germ-free IL-10(-/-) mice was dependent on the host consuming either a high-saturated MF diet or the gavage with TC. Together, these data provide a plausible explanation for the link between diseases such as IBD and dietary-mediated selection of gut microbial pathobionts in genetically susceptible hosts.

These drivers involve mucosal inflammatory pathways that become activated by allergens, microbial stimuli, or poorly understood exogenous or endogenous stimuli. The holy grail in the study of CRS is to identify specific drivers of mucosal inflammation and translate these into more effective treatment for CRS. Certain deficiencies in local innate immunity have been described in patients with CRS that predispose to increased sinus mucosal bacterial colonization/infection, including deficient local production of antimicrobial lactoferrin and deficient functioning of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R38. Conversely, certain innate factors, namely IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), are elaborated by sinus epithelial cells in response to microbial stimulation or airway injury and promote local TH2 inflammation. The precise physiologic role of these factors in innate or adaptive immunity is unclear, although IL-33 might function as an alarmin triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns. The cytokines IL-25 and TSLP, similarly promote proinflammatory tissue responses. Another feature of epithelial dysregulation in patients with CRS is overproduction of eosinophil-promoting C-C chemokines by sinus epithelium, perhaps driven in part through innate stimuli, as well as TH2 cytokines, such as IL-13. Strategies to reduce the microbial stimulation of maladaptive TH2 inflammation or to suppress the local elaboration of TH2-promoting epithelial factors, such as IL-33, have potential therapeutic benefit in patients with CRS, although the extent to which this is realized in patient care remains limited at present.

The oral microbiota is natural and provides important benefits to the host, including immunological priming, down-regulation of excessive pro-inflammatory responses, regulation of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems, and colonisation by exogenous microbes. On occasions, this symbiotic relationship breaks down, and previously minor components of the microbiota outcompete beneficial bacteria, thereby increasing the risk of disease. Antimicrobial agents have been formulated into many oral care products to augment mechanical plaque control. A delicate balance is needed, however, to control the oral microbiota at levels compatible with health, without killing beneficial bacteria and losing the key benefits delivered by these resident microbes. These antimicrobial agents may achieve this by virtue of their recommended twice daily topical use, which results in pharmacokinetic profiles indicating that they are retained in the mouth for relatively long periods at sublethal levels. At these concentrations they are still able to inhibit bacterial traits implicated in disease (e.g. sugar transport/acid production; protease activity) and retard growth without eliminating beneficial species.

The 16S rRNA gene from fresh fecal samples was amplified and pyrosequenced by using Roche-454 Titanium chemistry. A Core Measurable Microbiome (CMM) was generated for Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) detected in >75% of all samples and compositional features of CMM were compared between groups by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). IBS differentiated from HC by LDA using continuous variation in the species/OTUs or the CMM genera. When subcategorized based on bloating symptoms and bowel characteristics, the same subjects were also well differentiated from one another and from HC. ANOVA analysis showed quantitative species/OTU differences between the subgroups including IBS with and without bloating, and subtypes based on bowel characteristics. The clear LDA differentiation and the significant microbial taxa differences between the groups imply a significant association of the microbiota with bloating symptoms and bowel characteristics in IBS.

Immunopathology, including inherited immunodeficiencies, severe forms of infectious diseases, allergy and autoimmune diseases, are interferences with this stability which frequently include oligoclonal expansions of T lymphocytes.

The most common sialic acid in humans is a mono-N-acetylated version termed Neu5Ac (5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid). Many bacteria are known to access sialic acid using sialidase enzymes. However, in humans a high proportion of sialic acid contains a second acetyl group attached via an O-group, i.e. chiefly O-acetylated Neu5,9Ac2 or Neu5,4Ac2. This diacetylated sialic acid is not cleaved efficiently by many sialidases and in order to access diacetylated sialic acid, some organisms produce sialate-O-acetylesterases that catalyse the removal of the second acetyl group. In the present study, we performed bioinformatic and biochemical characterization of a putative sialate-O-acetylesterase from T. forsythia (NanS), which contains two putative SGNH-hydrolase domains related to sialate-O-acetylesterases from a range of organisms. Purification of recombinant NanS revealed an esterase that has activity against Neu5,9Ac2 and its glycolyl form Neu5Gc,9Ac. Importantly, the enzyme did not remove acetyl groups positioned at the 4-O position (Neu5,4Ac2). In addition NanS can act upon complex N-glycans released from a glycoprotein [erythropoietin (EPO)], bovine submaxillary mucin and oral epithelial cell-bound glycans. When incubated with its cognate sialidase, NanS increased sialic acid release from mucin and oral epithelial cell surfaces, implying that this esterase improves sialic acid harvesting for this pathogen and potentially other members of the oral microbiome. In summary, we have characterized a novel sialate-O-acetylesterase that contributes to the sialobiology of this important human pathogen and has potential applications in the analysis of sialic acid diacetylation of biologics in the pharmaceutical industry.

In Drosophila melanogaster, dual oxidase (Duox) kills pathogenic microbes by generating the microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in response to bacterially excreted uracil. The physiological function of enzymatically generated HOCl in the gut is, however, unknown aside from its anti-microbial activity. Drosophila TRPA1 is an evolutionarily conserved receptor for reactive chemicals like HOCl, but a role for this molecule in mediating responses to gut microbial content has not been described. Here we identify a molecular mechanism through which bacteria-produced uracil facilitates pathogen-clearing defecation. Ingestion of uracil increases defecation frequency, requiring the Duox pathway and TrpA1. The TrpA1(A) transcript spliced with exon10b (TrpA1(A)10b) that is present in a subset of midgut enteroendocrine cells (EECs) is critical for uracil-dependent defecation. TRPA1(A)10b heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes is an excellent HOCl receptor characterized with elevated sensitivity and fast activation kinetics of macroscopic HOCl-evoked currents compared to those of the alternative TRPA1(A)10a isoform. Consistent with TrpA1's role in defecation, uracil-excreting Erwinia carotovora showed higher persistence in TrpA1-deficient guts.

Paneth cells reside in the small intestine and produce antimicrobial peptides essential for the host barrier, principally human \u03b1-defensin 5 (HD5) and HD6. Patients with CD of the ileum are characterized by reduced constitutive expression of these peptides and, accordingly, compromised antimicrobial barrier function. Here, we present a previously unidentified regulatory mechanism of Paneth cell defensins. Using cultures of human ileal tissue, we showed that the secretome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls restored the attenuated Paneth cell \u03b1-defensin expression characteristic of patients with ileal CD. Analysis of the Wnt pathway in both cultured biopsies and intestinal epithelial cells implicated Wnt ligands driving the PBMC effect, whereas various tested cytokines were ineffective. We further detected another defect in patients with ileal CD, because the PBMC secretomes derived from patients with CD were unable to restore the reduced HD5/HD6 expression. Accordingly, analysis of PBMC subtypes showed that monocytes of patients with CD express significantly lower levels of canonical Wnt ligands, including Wnt3, Wnt3a, Wnt1, and wntless Wnt ligand secretion mediator (Evi/Wls). These studies reveal an important cross-talk between bone marrow-derived cells and epithelial secretory Paneth cells. Defective Paneth cell-mediated innate immunity due to inadequate Wnt ligand stimulation by monocytes provides an additional mechanism in CD. Because defects of Paneth cell function stemming from various etiologies are overcome by Wnt ligands, this mechanism is a potential therapeutic target for this disease.

For example, recent data have indicated that subtle mismatches between host and microbe genetic traits greatly affect the risk of gastric cancer. The ability of H pylori and its oncoprotein CagA to reprogram epithelial cells and activate properties of stemness show the sophisticated relationship between H pylori and progenitor cells in the gastric mucosa.

This showed that the presence of S. aureus in inflamed skin of AD patients was associated with a high IgE response, increased expression of inflammatory and Th2/Th22 transcripts and the prevalence of a peripheral Th2 anti-Der p response. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) exposed to the S. aureus and S. epidermidis secretomes were found to release pro-inflammatory IFN-\u03b3 and anti-inflammatory IL-10, respectively. Allogeneic moDC exposed to the S. aureus secretome also induced the proliferation of CD4+ T cells and this effect was counteracted by concurrent exposure to the S. epidermidis secretome. In addition, whereas the S. epidermidis secretome promoted the activity of regulatory T cells (Treg) in suppressing the proliferation of conventional CD4+ T cells, the Treg lost this ability in the presence of the S. aureus secretome. We therefore conclude that S. aureus may cause and promote inflammation in the skin of AD children through concomitant Th2 activation and the silencing of resident Treg cells.

The nature of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data, including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health.

We observed sputum bacterial composition to be generally stable over the preexacerbation period of clinical stability, but to change at the time of exacerbation, with specific enrichment in not only typical COPD-associated bacterial species (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae) but also other phylogenetically related species with pathogenic potential. Concurrently, we observed depleted abundance of other bacteria whose predicted metagenomes suggest functional capacities to produce a variety of antiinflammatory compounds.

During the life-long association with its human host, C. albicans generates genetically altered variants that are better adapted to changes in their environment. A prime example of this microevolution is the development of resistance to the commonly used drug fluconazole, which inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, during antimycotic therapy. Fluconazole resistance can be caused by mutations in the drug target, by changes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, and by gain-of-function mutations in transcription factors that result in the constitutive upregulation of ergosterol biosynthesis genes and multidrug efflux pumps. Fluconazole also induces genomic rearrangements that result in gene amplification and loss of heterozygosity for resistance mutations, which further increases drug resistance. These genome alterations may affect extended chromosomal regions and have additional phenotypic consequences. A striking case is the loss of heterozygosity for the mating type locus MTL in many fluconazole-resistant clinical isolates, which allows the cells to switch to the mating-competent opaque phenotype. This, in turn, raises the possibility that sexual recombination between different variants of an originally clonal, drug-susceptible population may contribute to the generation of highly fluconazole-resistant strains with multiple resistance mechanisms. The gain-of-function mutations in transcription factors, which result in deregulated gene expression, also cause reduced fitness. In spite of this, many clinical isolates that contain such mutations do not exhibit fitness defects, indicating that they have overcome the costs of drug resistance with further evolution by still unknown mechanisms.

Immunosenescence, an age-related deterioration in immune functions, is considered a major contributory factor for the higher prevalence and severity of infectious diseases and the poor efficacy of vaccination in the elderly. When compared with systemic immunosenescence, alterations in the mucosal immune system with age are less well understood. For this reason, this area deserves more extensive and intensive research and support. In this article, we provide an overview of age-associated changes occurring in systemic immunity and discuss the distinct features of mucosal immunosenescence.

This leads to chronic inflammation and an inability to initiate subsequent intestinal immune responses.", "Year": 2016, "Journal": "Cell host & microbe"}, {"PMID": 25732745, "Abstract": "IBD, comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic immunologically mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions between genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Established high-prevalence populations of IBD in North America and Europe experienced the steepest increase in incidence towards the second half of the twentieth century. Furthermore, populations previously considered 'low risk' (such as in Japan and India) are witnessing an increase in incidence. Potentially relevant environmental influences span the spectrum of life from mode of childbirth and early-life exposures (including breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure in infancy) to exposures later on in adulthood (including smoking, major life stressors, diet and lifestyle). Data support an association between smoking and Crohn's disease whereas smoking cessation, but not current smoking, is associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis. Dietary fibre (particularly fruits and vegetables), saturated fats, depression and impaired sleep, and low vitamin D levels have all been associated with incident IBD. Interventional studies assessing the effects of modifying these risk factors on natural history and patient outcomes are an important unmet need. In this Review, the changing epidemiology of IBD, mechanisms behind various environmental associations and interventional studies to modify risk factors and disease course are discussed.

Treating diabetes-prone rodents with probiotics or antibiotics prevents the development of the disorder. Diabetes-prone rodents also have a distinctly different gut microbiome compared with healthy rodents. Recent studies in children with a high genetic risk for type 1 diabetes demonstrate significant differences in the gut microbiome between children who develop autoimmunity for the disease and those who remain healthy. However, the differences in microbiome composition between autoimmune and healthy children are not consistent across all studies because of the strong environmental influences on microbiome composition, particularly diet and geography. Controlling confounding factors of microbiome composition uncovers bacterial associations with disease. For example, in a human cohort from a single Finnish city where geography is confined, a strong association between one dominant bacterial species, Bacteroides dorei, and type 1 diabetes was discovered (Davis-Richardson et al. Front Microbiol 2014;5:678). Beyond this, recent DNA methylation analyses suggest that a thorough epigenetic analysis of the gut microbiome may be warranted. These studies suggest a testable model whereby a diet high in fat and gluten and low in resistant starch may be the primary driver of gut dysbiosis. This dysbiosis may cause a lack of butyrate production by gut bacteria, which, in turn, leads to the development of a permeable gut followed by autoimmunity. The bacterial community responsible for these changes in butyrate production may vary around the world, but bacteria of the genus Bacteroides are thought to play a key role.
